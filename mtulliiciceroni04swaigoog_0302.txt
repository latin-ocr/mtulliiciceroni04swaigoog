t 149. incredibile cst sl attenderis: the correction ri lor uisi was
proposed first by Kindervater and then by Madv. and has been generally
adopted With it the meaning is ‘if you closely attend, it is wonderful
how great is the skill displayed by nature '. The other reading assigus tc
irre-edibile its literal soree of νίν credas a sense in which it is never used
by 0., thus ‘you would never believe, unless you paid clem attention to the
subject, the skill shown by natme ’. Asai is a little obscure and elliptical,

live senece, τὸ σπέρμα καὶ τὴν φωνήν, which last they define as πνεῦμα δια-
τεῖνον ἀπὸτοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ μέχρι φάρυγγος καὶ γλώττηι’. Galen (Hipp. Pha.
p. 14115135411.) finds fault with Zeno and Chrysippus for maintain-
ing that the heart, not the hrain, is the seat of reason, on the ground that
the voice is sentirem the heart. The word in the breast was called λόγος
ἐνδιάθετον, the word in the mouth λόγος προφορικός, cf. Zellcr lv p. 57,
