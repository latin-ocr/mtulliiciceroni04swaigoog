tives ol the· sentence are brought together see Mayor on 2 Phil. 66.

unius et viginti: we generally reckon 23 letters in the Latin alphabet,
but Y and Z were considered foreign letters and only used in Greek words:
Quintil. 14 ξ 9 speaks of X as the last letter of the alphabet. [X is the
last letter'in one of the praffiti of Pompeii, see Rieirc. Mas. N. F. ΧΠ 246.

annales Ennii: a history of Rome from its foundation in hexameter
verse. In it ‘he not only often succeeds in imitating Hdmeric simplicity,
but still more frequently makes his lines strikingly echo the solemnity
of the Roman character ². Mommsen.

quod-valere fortuna: the relative is explained by the following
clause, as in 1 2 qaod...trcbimar‚ and qaod coatircet, 138 qao qaid ab
sardias, 11 7 quod soletis, 11 17 ξ 24 qaod Oleamltcs docet...qacata ors iusim
in such cases it gets to be used like the Greek ὅ in Thuc. 11 40=‘whereas'‚
cf. Madv. mc. 167,11159.

· § 94. quern ad modum asseverant : most of the edd put a mark of
interrogation at the end of the sentence, understanding quem ad modam to
mean ‘how absurdly ². I do not know of any exact parallel for this use;
and, in any case, it is open to the objection of Heind., that after such
sentences as *bic epo coa mirer ’, ‘boc qai caiatiam ³, quibas praviter satis
Epicureae sententiae absmditatem expressit, frigide tanc denuo inferri iater-
ropatioacm. I think therefore that he is right in regarding this as an
example of attraction, in which the proper principal verb ‘est perfectas’ is
- drawnrintc the subordinate construction of the relative clause. He illus-
trates it from Off. 1 22 qaoar'rcm...at piacet Stoicis, quasia terris pipaamar

creari is similarly put for creamur. Holden in his note cites this passage,
