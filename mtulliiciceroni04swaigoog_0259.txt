Hyadas: mentioned by Homer and Hesiod‚ and therefore called by
Aratus (1 172) καὶ λίην κείνων ὄνομ’ ε’ίρετοι οὐδέ τοι οὕτως νὴκοοστοι. Ovid

the natural Latin for ὑός as 00101101 ὑπέρ. The present opinion 10 rather
that both the Greek and Latin are from the root nn and mean little pige,
as the other names 01 constellatione refer to material objecta chiefly
animala (Venicek Etynn and Nitusch 0010001172). Also the quantity 01
the vowel is against the derivation 01 ὑός (ὕ, like the oblique cases 01 ds)
from 10 (c). The form aenda may be compared with 100010, 00010010.

Gyncsurae: a name in apposition limiting the more general Arcti,
