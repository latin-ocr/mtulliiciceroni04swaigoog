δ PREFATORY NOTE.

ΙΝ the Preface to my former volume I expressed a
hope that. the remaining volume might be completed
for publication before the end of the year 1881. This

Ἴ hope has been disappointed partly owing to the labour

of expanding into a separate work the Sketch of
Ancient Philosophy, which formed part of the Intro·

j duction to¹ the First Bookff‘and partly from the un-

foreseen difficulties which I have encountered in tho
endeavour to explain fully the scientifio views of the
’ Ancients, as they are reported by Cicero in his Second
Book. The consequent increase in the size of the Com-¹
mentary has made it necessary to devote a whole
volume to this Book, and the publication of the third
and last Book must still be deferred to another year.

In the present volume Ι have been enabled to im·

prove on the Apparatus Oriticos of my former volume,

¹ owing to the kindness of the authorities of Merton
‚ Collega, Oxford, in lending me their valuable Codex

ι (Oxf. 0, here denoted simply as Oxf.) written in the
l rach century. It is older than any other English ms

aaran
