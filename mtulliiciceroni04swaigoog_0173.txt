it makes above and below the horinon' Munr0; Ph'n. 1171 (of the earth’s
sphericity) e freto emergentibus, qaae 10 anfracta pilae luteae, 1101011101.
Anfractcs=ombifrectas (like crecope), properly 01 0 twig broken so as to
form a curve. Key however suggests another form 01 the prefix, and would
divide itas amfractus, see Roby § 1843.

eminens, lacunosum: ‘no protuberance or depression' ; citha use 01
101000 for a dimple, and our phrase ‘pitted with smallpox'. On 01010000
see175n. and 105.

praestantissimae: Ι agree with Klotz in reading the superlative, 01101·
Nonius. It 11 certainly more natural with ee 0011110 than the positive, and
the reading 01 AV praestaretis 0101 11 easily explained by the repetition 01
01 10 010100 and 0101, 1111110110 10 his Mecteaice dilates on the wonderful
powers 01 the circle; in the de Ocelo 114 he cells the circle the first and
most perfect of plane figures, as the sphere is of solide: so Pythagoras
held τῶν σχημάτων rb rdhhrcrov σφαῖραν εἶναι τῶν στερεῶν, τῶν δὲ ἐπιπέδων
κύκλον, cf. cleomedes 1 148, Quintil1 10 § 41, Ocellus Lucanus ξ 1511. 514
1101011110 absence 01 beginning or end in the (spherical) form and (circulor)
movement of the world betokens its eternity'. Hence the comparison 01
God to the sphere by the Eleatic philosophare, and the Stoic argument for
the sphericity of the world, for this form πάντων σχημάτων πρωτεύει·

μόνον γὰρ τοῦτο τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ μέρεσιν ὁμοιοῦται, the world is therefore round
like the sun andmoon(Plec. Patr. 16). Pliny N.H. 11 2 argues that the
world is round 000 solam quea tatisfigcrc 0100111111 10 portibus vergit 10 sese

circulus: so nse, but Nonius p. 432 reads 011000, 0 form which we find
elsewhere in Ο. e. g. Aratea 148 risisti magnam 0001101100 serpere circam,

nonsense; one or two add quantam 101001 asumma, but that does not improve

matters, 1010011110111110010101111 refer to attremant, but would have 10 be

pass over these difficulties, the (1010111011 11 still defective; in any figure
