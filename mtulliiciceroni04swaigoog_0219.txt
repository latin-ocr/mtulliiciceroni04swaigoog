to express the ordinary course of nature, and that, in speaking‘of its being
generated from living principles, he refers to the periodic regeneration of
tha world In the cyolio conflagration the ordinary course of nature is
suspended, the universe retires into its tiery seed, of which Diog. tells us
(le 136) θεός ε’στιν ἄφθαρτος καὶ ἀγένητος, δημιουργὸς ὧν τῆς διακοσμήσεως,
κατὰ χρόνων παιδς περιόδους ἀναλίσκων εἷς ἑαυτὸν τὴν ἅπασαν οὐσίαν καὶ

πάλιν ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ γεννῶν. So we read (Phoe. Phil :1 7) the Stoics define God

. as πῦρ τεχνικὸν ὁδῷ βαδίζον έπὶ γενέσει κόσμου, ε’μπεριειλῃφός τε πάντας roric

σπερματικοὺς λόγους, while natiue itself is defined as working in aocordance
with these, ἔστι δέ φύσις ἕξις ἒξ ου’τῆς κινουμένη κατὰ σπερματικοὺς λόγους
(Diog. v11 148). Sch. speaks of this clause as being out of place here, since
Ppovidence is shown in the government,·but not in the formation of the
world, There seems no ground for such a limitation; and as a matter of
fact-O. has already divided his subject into these two parts, initio emuti-
teter, omnitempore administrari. Epicurus had taught that the world
was produced by tha fortuitous movements of dead atoms: Balbus main-
tains in opposition to this that it is due to aerimantia princepie ; cf. below

tanti operia, also ἐξ 93, 95, 115. We need not at present define the latter
more closely: that which is of the nature of soul is, as Plato is so fond of

insisting‚ essentially p1iorto that which is without soul.

argument in the wrong order. We can hardly imputo this to the

carelessness of a scribe, as the words are quoted in the same order by
Laot. 1 5 and Salvianus Get. 1 l § 4.) ·

§76. Democritus umidam, Epicurus imagines: Ihave said (on 1 -
49) that it seemed to me probable that some of the later Epicureans had
adopted the more spiritual theism of Democritus. In this passage how-
ever l-understand Cic. to be drawing a distinction between the crude
intermundian gods of Epicurus and the Democritean spirits of the air.
We may compare the distinction in Sext Emp. 111 42, where the doctrine
of the εἴδωλα is ascribed to Democritus, the φαντασία εἰδώλων, the nightly
vision of images to Epicurus, τδ δὲ εἴδωλα εἶναι έν τῷ περιέχοντι ὑπερφυῆ
