At The sympathy which unitcs ell the pnrts of the universe

At. Zeno's argument for the divinity of the universe (sud · “

’ therefore ‘indirectly for the Divino Existence, since the universe
existe). (1) Whet hes resson is better then what hes not resson,

therefore the universe, ss the best of things, must possess resson:
similarly it may be proved to be wise, blessed, oter-nul, end therefore
'Gon (2) The universe must be sentient because it hus sentient
parts (3) It must be rational because it gives birth to wbstis
rational. ((20-22.

Αἰ. Physicel argument for divine existence: (1) hest is the
csuse of motion end of life ; the whole universe is perveded by heet3

(4) Men is born to contemplate and imitate the universe to' which
