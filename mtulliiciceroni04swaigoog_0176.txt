portiordar movements of the planete, ie brought out clearly in Plato Tim. 34
foll. thus summed up by A. Butler: ‘Pl first presente us with two vest

ephoros which ombody tho principles of Samo and Differont (ταύτὸν καὶ
θᾶτερον). Tho outer ephoro includes tho innumorablo multitudo of tho
fixed stare : the iuner ephoro is subsequently dividod by the divine Artiet
uu sevon ephoros, which revolve with various volocities, and in various
directione’. Eudoxus resolved tho complex apparent movements ottho
planete into the simple circulor movoments of several supporting ephoros,
du τὴν μὲν πρώτην τὴν τῶν ἀπλανῶν ἄστρων εἶναι, τὴν δὲ δευτέρον κατὰ τὸν διὰ
μέσον τῶν ζῳδίων (Arist Met. Λ 8 p. 1073 b). Olocmedos 1 3 illustratos
the double movemeut by the comparison of people on board ehip walking
in a direction opposite νο thot in which the vessol was going, or νο an ant
going round tho potters whoel 1n a direction opposito νο that of its
movemont. Tho apparent daily movemont of tho outor ephoro from east
to wost in the plano of tho aquator, ie of course duo to tho daily rotation ol
the earth, the ‘different’ movomont cf the planete is duo to their periodic
revolution round tho eun in tho plano of the ecliptic.

nullum-vestigium inflectet: doce not bend asido (lit. inwards) a
single stop-of its course, as the sun does to nort—h and south, but describes
a per-loct circle.

continuae conversiones: thie ie a true description according νο our
modern asuonomy, but scarcely agrees with what is said below ξ 51, os νο
their varying ratos of motion and occasional pauses.

isdem spatiis: Abl of Place; tho eun, moon and planete aro in the
sarno stadium or raceccurso (cf. Virg. θ. 1 513, 'Aoo v 316), viz. the
ncdiac. If wo distinguish between spatici and curribus, the former would
bo tho broad band in which all tho movements take place, tho latter tho
particular line followed by each without change in successivo poriods. Of.
