logers considered Ἦρα to be another form of ἀήρ, eg. Plato Oratyl. 404 icor

· et similitudo est seri aetheris et cum ec conjunctio: the edd. change
the first et into ei after Probus. Ithink both are needed: Juno issister
and therefore like, wife and therefore united. Also it seems to me there
would be awkwardness in ai and eo referring to different subjecte. I have
ventured to insert aeri before οοιΙιούε, as Mu has donc 1 10³. It is to a
certain extent in favour of this emendation, that Probus has aeris instead
of aetham. The Dat. is of course dependent on eat, as in Lep. 1 25 ast
igitar bomini οιιοι deo similitudo.

sed iunonem-nominatam: this clause is questioned by Baiter,
Stamm (Imapol. p. 33) and Vaucher ; but it is preserved by Probus, and 1
see no particular objection to it.- It would be strange ifthe etymology
were wanting in the case of Juno alone. I take sed to introduce an
incidente] remark like αιιεεοι or δέ, ‘by the way'3 not (ss Degenhart p.
65) to denote the opposition between the physical derivation of Ἦρα aud
the non-physica] derivation of ‘J uno ’. Perhaps Ailen is right in inserting
ean after Juoooem. Credo implies that Cic. is not quite certain as to the
etymology, which hc has borrowed from Varro L. L. v 67.

[The stem Junon isin Roman vowcls jin-enon, in primitive ρὀιο-οιι-αιι.
The first syllable is scen in Jov-is Δι-ός (εΔιΡτος) : the second as well as
the first in Δι-ών-η, Βύ-ᾶινο, Ζᾰν (εΔι-αν), Jonas (the old or Dcric ο
corresponding, as often‚*to ω), and also jeta-eas, jein-ior, joir-eroco re·
minding one of βοῶπις Ἦρα and of the use of heifers in the rites of J uno.
