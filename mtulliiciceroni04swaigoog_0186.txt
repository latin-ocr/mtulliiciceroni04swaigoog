nec habent aetherios cursus neque caelo ιιιλοοιοιιιοοε two expla-
natione of the appetent movement oi the fixed stars were given by the
older philosophers (1) that the fixed stare were fastened like naila in a
solid heaven or sphere and oi course revolved with it, ἥλων δίκην καταπεπη-
γέναι τῷ κρυσταλλοειδεῖ, as is said oi Anaximenes Plan. Phil. 11 14, and
Empedocles, ib. 133 Anaximander, Pythagoras and Parmenides preferred
ιο spealr of the stars being attached to spherae : (2) that they were light
bodies borne along by αἰθέριος δῖνοι (Arist. aa. 3⁷9); so Xenophanes,
Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Democritus. Aristotle took the former view
λείπεται τούς μὲν κύκλους κινεῖσθαι, τὰ δι’ ἄστρα ἠρεμεῖν rut ἐνδεδεμένα τοῖς
κύκλοις κινεῖσθαι Cael. 11 8 ; in Met. 1111 7 foll. he enumeratas 55 spherae, in
addition ιο that of the lixed stars, which were required ιο explain the
movements of the sun, moon and planets; both the stare aad the spherae
are composed of ether; see Levis Astr. p. 161 foll.; Zeller nr p. 453. It
would seem that Balbus here condemns both explanatione, and would
attribute the movement oi the fixed stars, as well as of the planete, to
their own free will: so Manutius ap. Lesoalop. (not in Ver. ed) οαραοι
Stoici stellae αιτιοι (rather aa aethere αοιοο) aiae caeto affiaaa ease, quod
antecameram ιιιο minamur et motu calcatorio ferat. aetherius cursus
will not then mean ‘the path of the stars through the ether ', for this the
Stoica admitted, see below t 117 ia catere astra calcantur ; but ‘a move·
ment caused by ether', going by ether, aa we'talk of going by steam; ci.
below aaa ea aethera ea ιιοιοοο ιιι οοιιιονᾳιιοοι, and, for the expression,

· such phrases as awla οιιιιοοιιι, cqaartaworked by an aas or by water. ⁴

The argument however is not very clear: two theorias having been put
iorward aad declared inadmissible, why should not thisbe shown in the

oase of the second (enthimemate) as well as the first (αοιλοιιοι aarum
’ aad if,as appears below, the fixed stara have their sphera, how does the
Stolo view differ after all from that of Aristotlel All that is there asserted
is that the motion of the sphere is independent of the surroundr'ng ether,
but that is admitted by Arist. at all events in the case of the planetary
spheres. One expects the assertion that each fixed star moves inde-
pendently and yet in such harmony as to give the appearance of a great
all-embracing sphere. Apparently Chrysippus denied their independent
motion (Stob. Ecl. 1446 ἐντῷ αἰθέριοι ἄστρα καθίδρυται, and shortly alter-
