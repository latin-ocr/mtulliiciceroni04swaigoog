natura, vi, voluntate: here we have οιι taking the place of fortem
above: compare Arist. Met. v 5 p. 1015, where, after giving an account of
φύσις, he goes on ιο speak of ἀναγκαῖον and says in one use it is equivalent
ιο τὸ βίαιον, τοῦτο δ’ ε’στὶ τὸ παρὰ τὴν ὁρμὴν (τφύσιν) καὶ τὴν προαίρεσιν.
So Eva 11 1 virtue is neither φύσει nor παρὰ φύσιν (εβίᾳ) but (as shown
ab length in bk ΠΙ) προαιρέσει, οι Cael. 111 2 κινεῖσθαι ἀναγκαῖον βίᾳ, εἶ μὴ
οἰκείαν ἔχει κίνησιν, τὸ δὲ βίᾳ καὶ παρὰ φύσιν ταύτάν.
. quae natura moverentur...circumferretur: Aristotle distinguishes
two kinds of simple motion, the circular and the rectilinear: the latter
belongs to the sublunary clemente, thus it is the nature of-fire and air to
riso from the centra towards the circumferenoe, of water and earth ιο sink
towards the centre; the former (the circular) naturally belongs ιο the

superlunar region, the heaven and the spheres on which the heavenly bodies '

revolve (ἀναγκαῖον εἶναι’ τι σῶμα ἁπλοῦν ι πέφυκε φέρεσθαι τὴν κύκλῳ κίνησιν
κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ φύσιν, Phys. vm 9, Cael. 1 ι). We do not however find
him ever denying that the circular movement is natural, or contrasting it,
as voluntary, with the natural movements of the terrestria] elements. On
the contrary he blames Plato for defining seul as the sels-moving principle ’
(Aa. 13), and for assigning circular movements ιο the seul, both in the
macrocosm and in the microcosm, as opposed ιο ιιι rectilinear movements
of bodies (dc ούσος τὰς τοῦ ούρανοῦ φοράς τὰς τῆς ψυχῆς κινήσεις, ibid ξ 12,
cf. Plato Loy. x 897 foll, yet elsewhere Arist. seems ιο have compared the
activity of νοῦς ιο circular movement‚ see Trend. in loo.) ; see also Cael. 11
1 ‘it is impossible that the circular movement of the heaven should be
caused by the 'compulsion ofa soul residing in it, for that would be to at-
tribute the fate of Ixion to such a soul. It moves by the attractive force
of the First Mover, that divine supernatural principle which κινεῖ od
κινούμενον ’. Still we are not ιο think of the heavenly, bodies as consisting
of brute matter, Cael. 11 12 ἀλλ’ ἡμεῖς eis περὶ σωμάτιον αύτῶν μάνον, καὶ
μονάδων τάξιν μὲν ἐχόντων, ἀψύχων δὲ πάμπαν, διανοούμεθα· δεῖ δ’ <ds με·
τεχάντιον πράξεως καὶ ζῴης...διὸ δεῖ νομίζειν καὶ τὴντῶν άστρων πρᾶξιν εἶναι
τοιαύτην οἵαπερ ἡ τῶν ζῴων καὶ φυτῶν· καὶ γάρ ἐνταῦθα αἱ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου
πλεῖσται πράξεις...τῷ δ’ ὥς άριστα ἔχοντι ούθὲν δεῖ πράξεως· ἔστι γὰρ αύτῷ
τι οὗ ἔνικας in Met. ΧΠ 8 p. 1073 a, it is distinotly said that there must be
besides the First Movcr a separate eternal mover for each of the separate
planetary movements3 cf. Ocel. 11 3 θεοῦ d' ἐνέργεια cessavisse? ἀνάγκη
τῷ θείῳ κίνησιν ἀΐδιον ύπάρχειν. ἐπεὶ δ’ ὁ ούρανὸς τοιοῦτος (σῶμα γάρ τι
θεῖον) διά τοῦτο ἔχει τὸ ἐγκύκλιον σῶμα, ά φύσει κινεῖται κύκλῳ del, and
Plac. Pto. 11 3, Stob. Eeti 486. Proclus on Tim. 82 Α infers the same
from Μιιιιρι. xn lp. 1072 b 3 (κινεῖ ds ἐρώμενον) ‘ if the universe is in love
with Reason and moves towards it, it must have feelings and impulses of
its own ‘. So Theophrastus (fr. 12 §d 7-9 Wimmer) speaks of the ὄρεξις
