marte 100111110οα io rotundo e medio ad aaronem (cited by Mu. praef. on
Fla. 1 17). Klotz followed by Sch proposed to complete the definitior] by
inserting obtqua after medtbque, but this use 01 abique was denied to be
Ciceronian‚ see Lachmann 011 Lucr. p. 250, Kiihners translation (where he

refers to his ed maj. of the Toacrdam p. 525⁴), and Sch App„ and the ,

emendation was abandoned by Sch in his last ed. I propose 1ο read
1111111010 after tractandas,v cf. credique ad inferos tantundem ciue ert, unse. 1
43. It may bc objected that acutique should properly denote the starting-
point, to which it is here opposed; but I think it may be understood
generally to mean ‘on every side', like ab 00101 parte, without reference
to motion. [This might be illustrated from Boethius Art. Geom. p. 394
cd. Fricdlein‚ plano vero commater quoe aequalder rectos lineet 00111αο1
oeream finitor, ‘a plane suriace is one which is bounded by right lines in
every direction'. For the use of ab see Gr. § 1813. R.] Failing this,
I should adopt Briegeds ahod morte actrcmam, see his Beer. z. Krit. d. cio.
Posen 1873, pp. le, 21 Fleckeisen (Jahrb. f. el. Pu. x p. 142) seems to
me to have utterly failed in his endeavour to defend the old reading. Ι
aptius: ‘moro compact'‚ cf. 1 37 cadmeae aptum.
