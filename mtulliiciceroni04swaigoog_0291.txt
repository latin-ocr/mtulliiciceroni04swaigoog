the absurdity 01 deriving all the nervas from the heart'. Sprengol 1 034
speaks of Herophilus (fi. about 300 aa.) as the first who derived tho nervas
from the brain' and spinal marrow, and distinguished between nervas of
motion and sensation, see above ξ 128 11. Galen (Hippo. 01 Plat. p. 187 Κ.)
attributes to Hippocrates right views as to the origin of the nervas and
severely condemns Arist. and Praxagoras for deserting his opinione. lt
seems this question was connected with that oi the seat 01 the ἡγεμονικόν,
thus in p. 649 Galen states as axiomatic principles (1) ὅπου τῶν νεύρων η’
ἀρχή, ἐνταῦθα καὶτὸ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡγεμονικόν, and (2) ἡάρχὴ τῶν νεύρων ἐν τῷ
ἐγκεφάλῳ. The Stoice maintained that the beart was the seat 01 the
ἡγεμονικόν (Zeller 1v p. 197 foll). '
