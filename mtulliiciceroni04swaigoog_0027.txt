induced Hirzel (Umaaalaaqan zu Cicero'e pbilosopbssehen Schrfflen

different parts of Cicero’s book. In the first place Cicero writes to

appeared, asking for an epitome of the writings 01 (laelius by Brutus,
end for Panaetius περὶ προνοίας. Must we not suppose that he esked
for them with the intention of using them for the book which he was
then preparing, especially as we find that he quotes from Caelius in
§ 8, and as he chose Panaetius as his authority in the first two books
of the De Officiis? Much that has been said in favour of the claime
of Posidonius is also applicabis 1ο Panaetius. He wrote a good style, '
was an admirer of Plato and Aristode, and departed on many points
from the rigid dogmatism of the older Stoice. We are not told how-
ever that he paid much attention 1ο sciense, and there are certainly
parts cf this second book which could not possibly have been derived
from him. For instance Divination is defended in §5 7-12 and
again in 162, 163, but we know from Oieero himself Dio. 1 12, 1188,
97, as well 00 from other writers (see Zeller ιν p. 567), 1801 Ρο800
tius was a disbeliever in divination 3 Schiche and Hartfelder even
suppose 810 treatise περὶ προνοίας to have been the authority used by
(licere for the second book 01 810 de divinatione, in which the nega-
tive side is supported. Again the immortality, or rather the eternity
of the soulis maintained iu §62, but, as we see from the Tusculana
(1 42, 78), 1810 was entirely rejected by Panaetius Alsothe manner
in which his opinion in regard 10 180 (lyelic Oonflegration is referred
to is inconsistent with the idea that (licere could have been there
copying from him. Still there is the fect that Oioero was studying
his περὶ προνοίας 01 180 time when he was engaged on his own book
on the subject. But so also he was studying Phaedrus περὶ θεῶν,
when writing about the Epicurean theology, and yet we have seen
reason to believe that his authority for 1801 portion of his treatise was
not Phaedrus, but Γ8080000101. ip. xarv foll. If Cicero used Pa-
naetius for his treatise on Divination, which is merely a sequel to the
N. D, 1810 would be quite sufficient explanation for his nequest to
Atticus, but he may also have thought of getting further material
either for his exposition or for his criticism of the Stoic doctrine on
Providenee. Hirzel however is 01 opinion that the second book
shows signs of having been compiled from different sources, and thet
while one part is taken from Posidonius, another part is from Apollo
