difficulty in refuting the rather wild suggestion that the end seotion
is derived from Apollodorus, as being the chief writer on the inter-
pretation of myths

My notes show a distinct connexion between this book of the
N. D. and the 9th book of Sextus Empirious on the one hand¹ and
the treutises de Providentia ol Philo end Theodoret on the other.
Iam not aware whether there has been any cureful investigation of
the sources of these books, but Ι should conclude that they were,
in pert at least, taken either from Posidonius direotly or from writers
who had copied from him.

¹ Compare particularly the quotation lrom Xenophon in 5 18 with Sext. rx
92, that from Aristotle ξ 95 with Sextus rx 20, the comparison of the movements
ol the heavenly bodies to the movements of an army or a ship in ἓξ 85, 87, 89,
with Sext. 11 26, 78ς and the reference to the orrery in ς 88 with Sextus rx 114.
