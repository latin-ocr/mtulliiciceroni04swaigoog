held in the hand and be directed towards the machine and so receive the
¹ · gradual, or ‘glow', discharge from it. lf a cloud isthe body charged with
electricity, points directed towards it will carry off the discharge from it in
tha same way. Sc at sea this ‘glow' discharge is frequently seen: the ·
ship is charged with electricity from the earth or sea, but the density at
points is very 'much greater than over other portione of the suriaco and
so the discharges take place at the points.” Compare Darwin’s account ol
a scene hc witnessed in the estuary of the Plata (Natat-clieta chayc, p.
39), ‘tha masthead and yard-armends shone with St Elmo’s light; and
. the form of the vane could almost be traced, as if it had been rubbed with
phosphorus The sea was so highly luminosa, that the tracks of the
penguins were marked bya fiery wake, and the darkness of the sky was
momentarlly illuminated by the most vivid lightning '.
