ise certain analogy between this and two Christian arguments, the one

- from the nature of God inserting the antecedent probability of revele-

tion: ‘if there be a wisc end good (lod, it is probhble that he would
reveal something of his will to men’; the other from the fact of prophecy
inferring a divine Inspirer‚ ‘the prediction of particular future events
is beyond the power of men, but the life and death of Christ, and
the 'dispersion of thedone, ere perticulur events predicted by Jewieh
prophete centuries before they came to pass, therefore these prophete were
gifted with a superhumen power'. Oiccro’s real belief in regard to divine-
tion is stated Lep. 11 {thri deor erec corwedinne eornrnqne niente mnndum
