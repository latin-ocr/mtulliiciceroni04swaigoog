riae, is usually about three ieet long, lives at the 'bottom of the sea, by
means of its fins stirs up the mud in such a manner as ιο conceal itself
from other fishes, has three long filaments on the upper part of the head:
· the glittering appendages' attha end of these filaments are said ιο attract
'the smaller fishes, like a bait. See Εαῃ. Cycl. Aristotle mentions it in
speaking of the stratagema of animala, (H. A. 1x 37) ὁ μὲνγὰρ βάτραχος τοῖς
πρὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν άποκρεμαμίνοις (so. θηρεύει, ‘ensnares the fish with the
filaments which hang in front of his eyes ’)‚ dv τὸ μὲν μῆκός ἐστι τριχοειδές,
ἐπ’ άκρου δὲ στρογγύλον ὥσπερ προσκείμενον ἑκατέρῳ δελέατος χάριν· ὅταν οὖν
ἐν τοῖς άμμάδεσιν ἢ θολεριύδεσιν ἀναταράξας κρύψῃ ἔαυτόν, ἐπαίρει τά τριχοίδη,
κοπτόντων δὲ τῶν ίχθυδίων συγκατάγει μέχρι περ ἂν πρὸς τά στόμα προσαγάγῃ.
He calls ib βάτραχον τὸν ἁλιέα καλούμενον, and so Plin. H. N. 1x 42 μύθοιο-
tria. Schneider in his note on Arist. 1. c. says of this passage of oie. qaae-
dam οαιάιιιιεο tidenter, and certainly we should have expected the antece-
dent to ad qaae to have some reference ιο the filaments described by
Arist: ifthe reading is correct, O. seems to have supposed the raaa to
have concealed itself in the sand by the sea (prope αῃιιαια), not actually
in the sea.

miluo bellum cum corvo: this' is described by Arist. HN. IX 1
ὑφαιρεῖται τοῦ κόρακος ὁ ἰκτῖνος ὅ τι ἂν ἔχῃ, διὰτὸ κρείττων εἶναι τοῖς ὄνυξι καὶ
τῇ πτήσει, but it is of other birds, especially the κορώνῃ and γλαύξ, that he
says τά ᾠά κατεσθίουσιν ἀλλήλων. Plin. 1x 25 says the aesalon and chloreus
destroy the eggs of the coreas. =

grues trianguli efficere formam: Aristode (H. A. 1x 10) says a good
deal about cranes, but does not give the particulare mentioned by O. which
are probably taken from the dialogus De philosophia (see above ξι 42,
44, 95). Pliny (π. Η. x aa a aa) aene ne seme with reference a> wad '
