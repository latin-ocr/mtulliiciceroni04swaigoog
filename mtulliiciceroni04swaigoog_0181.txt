occultantur: at the time of their conjunction with the sun.

recedunt: at the time of their eastward or westward elongation.

*comedunt-subsequuntur: ‘when Venus and Mercury have re-
ceded from the sun eastward to their respective dmtanoes, they remain
for a time, as it were, immovable with respect to it, and are carried along
with it in the ecliptic with a motion equal to its own ; but presently they
begin to approach it, or, which comes to the same, their motion in longi·
tude diminishes, and the sun gains upon them....Then for a time they are
not seen at ell...(0n their reappearance) their motion is rapidly retrograde,
until they reaoh their greatest western elongation, when the motion again
becomes direct, and they acquire sufficient speed to commanos overtaking

the existing works of Arist, probably it may have been in the dialogus
dc Philosophia from which so much of O.'s argumentis borrowed (cf.
Bywater in J. of Philoioyy 1. c.) : we do find however (aueo. 1 14 § 20) a
reference to a periofficel deluge, γίνεται διὰ χρόνων εἱμαρμένον, olor ἐν ταῖς
κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ὥραις χειμιόν, οὕτω περιόδου τινὸς μεγάλης μέγας χυμόν καὶ
ὑπερβολὴ ὄμβρων. Probably the conception ofa Oosmic Year was first
introduced among the Greeks by the Pythagoreans (Zeller 1 pp. 397, 410) ;
it is also attributed ιο Heraclitus (ZellerI 640), but the earliest notice of it
occurs in Plat. ria. 39 ὅ γε erasos ἀριθμός χρόνον τόν τέλεον ἐνιαυτὸν πληροῖ

10,ooc years (Zeller 11 p. 264). Other emendations of the length of the
Great Year are given in Censor. 1.0., Piae. Pitt. 11 32 (Diels p. 363),
Macrob. S. Sc. 11 11, Sextus Emp. v 105, where Fabricius refers to Thoma-
