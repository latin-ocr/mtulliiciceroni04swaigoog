xx INTRODUUI'ION.

129, much 61 the sectien en anatomy §§ 134-146, show how largely
the author whom (licere follows was influeneed by Aristetle. Ne
doubt this is true generally 61 the Steie scheol, but the views put
forward in seme 61 the above-cited passages are opposed te these 61
Ι the older Stoica, and may with much probability be attributed to
Posidonius, 61 whom Strabo says (11 3 58) πολὺ γάρ ἐστι τὰ αἰτιολογικὸν
παρ’ cinq* καὶ vd α’ριστοτελίζον.

The next point 161 consideration is whether we have any grounds
161 supposing that the treatise 61 Posidonius, quoted in 1 123, would
deal with the same topica 66 Cicero’s similarly named work. Schwencke
(Jahrb. s 61666. Patet. 1877 pp. lae-140) points eut that in
' general the Stoice treated the questiones the Existenee and Nature
611116 Geds separately from 1116161 the Providential Gevernment
61 the World. Thus the περὶ προνοίας 61 Chrysippus is a distinct
work from bis περὶ θεῶν, and Diogenes Laertius mentions thamin
different parts 61 bis 7111 beek, the former in 6. 138, tbe latter in 6
148. Β61 61 Posidonius and 61 him alone, we 616 16Ιᾶ thet he
treated 61 both subjeets under tha title 61 περὶ θεῶν (Dieg. 16). Η16
11661166 consisted 61 five books, in the lst 61 which he maintained
the divinity 61 the heaven and the universe, in 1116 3rd (so Cobet,
net l3th as in Hlibner's ed.) argued in favour 61 the providential.
’ government 611116 world, while in the 5111 be eonfeted the Epicurean
doctrine (N. D. 1 123). It seems net improbable therefore that, as
Schweneke suggests, tbe first four books 61 Posidonius may have

corresponded with the quadrupla division with which (licere eem-
menees his second book.

One ether slight indication 61 the author may be found in§ 165,
where Rhodes is put on 6 level with Reme, Athens and Sparta, see
Mr Roby’s nete en the passage. As Panaetius was beru at Rhodes,
while Posidonius resided there 161 the greater pert 61 his 1116, this
might at first sight appear te be equally in favour 61 either euther-
ship, but there 6611 be little doubt that such an allusion is mere
natural in the mouth 61 ene who, like Posidonius, presided over the
University 61 Rhodes and toek a leading part in its politice, 11161161
ene who spent the active years 61 his 1116111 Athens andin Rome

and never returned te his native land 61161 he had 61166 1611 11 (cic.
Taso. v 107).

I think that the various consideratione adduced above leave little
doubt as 16 the Posidonian authorship 61 Oieero’s 11661166, but there
616 seme facts which appear te militate against this and which have
