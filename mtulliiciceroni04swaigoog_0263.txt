Boou 11 cn. xnrv § 113. 233·

aspecitcr ‘the Scorpion is seen as he rises’. But it may be a question
whether the quotation was not at first shorter, and whether the words
ct sese osteadens aceepit may not have been added, as in a former quotation,
from the Ptaerwmeec ; see crit. n. The omission of ct in uss is probably
aocidental owing to the -cr preceding, unless capaciter is a corruption for Ι
aspicito at, the imperative being, more naturally than the Ind, followed
by ιιι with Ind.

ostendens emergit: some edd. have emergeret οιιιιιιίιι, but it is not
uncommon for themora important word to be thus subordinated to the
less important, as in § 115 catera omnia conficiens funditor, where we
might have expected fisso conficit.

alce: Baehrens and Orelli read olto with Grotius, ‘rising out of the
deep '. Alte is common in the older pects, as of the sun in Lucr.1v 404
jebar ert‘qere alte, v 610 roseo alte lampade l . .

posteriore trahens-Arcum: ‘drawing after itabant bow with its
powerful tail'. cic. here mistakes the force of l. 305 ἀνέλκετοι ἐγγύθι κέν-
τρου, ‘the Archer is drawing the bow near the Scorpion's sting’ (=teaelit)‚
and confoundsitwith the ἕλκεται of l. 342 ἡ δὲ Κυνὸς μεγάλοιο κατ’ οὐρὴν ἕλκε·
τοι Ἀργώ (=trotitca·).' Arcas is used for the whole constellation by German.
l. 311, 668. The Archer‚ whom Cic. calls Sagittipotens (Placen. 73) ›Sopat-
tcrics (1279) Arcitenens (l. 405), was supposed to be a centaur. Ι read
flexum here with Sch, ss it is found in all the nse of the ΡΙιοιιιοιιι, and
there seems no reason why O. should have changed it for the hyperbolical
phacae, which means ‘tied in a lmot'.

ouem propter-Ales: five lines are here omitted containing the ante·
cedent to pacm. As it stands, it can only be ercam, which gives a wrong
position for the Ales (on which see ξ 112), The corresponding line 85
in the Placere. begins with qaam referring to the antecedent aequa in 1 84,
cf. Aratus 311 ἔοιι δι’ τοι προτέρω βεβλημένοι ἄλλος 'Olenia αὐτὸς ἄτερ τόξον·

either that with which Apollo slew the Cyclopes or that with which
Hercules killed the eagle of Prometheus. convolvitur: referring to
the rotatory movement of the heaven

Aquila se portet: of. Phaeca. 24 vector pedes portat. The eagle is
called Jove Ales auctiva (Placen. 294); it is alluded to by Eur. ΒΙιιιιιι 530.
For cum corpore cf. above ξ 106 cam gorgite.

deinde Delphinus: Aratus continues⁹(l. 316) Δελφὶς δ’ οι] μάλα πολλὸς
ἐπιτρέχει Αἷγοκερῆῖ, According to Geminus it was raised to heaven by
Neptune for revealing the hidingplace of Amphitrite ; others identified it
with the delphin of Arion.

exinde Orion: Aratus 322 λοξὸς μὲν ratpoto τομῇ (‘under the secticn
of Taurus') faccialiter αὐτὸς Ὠρίων. In Homer he appears as a might)⁷
hunter, σθένος Ὠρίωνος, eyed by the bear he is pursuing (Il. xv111 486), and
following the chase even in the lower world (Od. x1 570) Ὠρίωνα πελώριον.
