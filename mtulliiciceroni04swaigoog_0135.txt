tained on the subject cf tides in the Pice. Ptii. 111 17 (πῶς ἀμπώτιδες
γίνονται καί atrapitena: Aristotle and Heraclitus say the tides are pro·
duced by the sun, which is the exciting cause of winds3 these when they Δ
rise push the sea before them and cause it tc swell, when they sink the
sea falls back 'into its place. Pytheas (the famous traveller of Massilia ·
rac. 300, see Bunbury Aac. θυαμ. 1 p. 600) says the tide rises when the
moon is waxing and siuks as it wanes; Plato, that there is a kind of
natural circulation of the waters of the sea (the reference is to the de-
scription oi the rivers of Tartarus, Ptoeolo p. 111); Timaeus, that the
tides of the Ocean cre caused by the violent torrente of Ga1d; Seleucus

(cf. Plut. Ploo. Quaeri. p. 1006) that they proceed from the contrary cur-
rente of air generated by the rotation of the earth and the mccn. Bunbury
writes as follows (1197) ‘Posidonius (O.’s chief authority in this book)
appears to have been the first Greek writer that arrived at clear ideas
about the tides. For this he was indebted to his jcurney to Spain, where
he spent some timeat Gades, and from his own observation, coupled with
the information he received from the natives, acquired a distinct know-
ledge not only of the diurnal recurrence of the tides, but of· their monthly
cycles of variation, which he correctly ascribed to the influence of the
. moon, and its' different positione with regard tc the sun ; so that the
highest tides, as he observed, always coincided with the full moon and
the lowest with the half-moon or intermediate quarter', cf. Strabo 1113
p. 229, 5 p. acl-264, where he tells us that Aristotle had referred the
tides to the peculiar nature of the Spanish coast, but that Pos. rightly
maintained τὴν τοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ κίνησιν ὑπέχειν ἇστεροειδῆ περίοδον, τήν μέν
ἡμερήσιον ἆποδιδοῦσαν, τήν δὲ μήνιαῖαν, τὴν δ’ ἐνιαυσιαῖον, συμπαθῶς τῇ σελήνῃ.
Strabo (1 1 p. 9) thinks Homer referred. tc this in his ἀψόῤῥοος Ὠκεανός and
the description of Charybdis. Though the true theory of tides had thus
been established early in the first century a. e. yet we find later writers still
doubting as to their cause, e. g. Lucan 1 412, as to whether they are due to
. the wind or tc the moon, Pomp. Mela (time of Caligula> 111 1 as to whether
they may not be due to the respiration of the mundane animal. ‘The
carly Stolos, in this agreeing with the Epicureans, thought th'e subject
undeserving oi the curiosity oi a wise man. See Diog. L. vn 123 τὸν
