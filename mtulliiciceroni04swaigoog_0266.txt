does not make it quite clear how the doctrine oi the upward movement of
air and lire is to be reooueiled with the belief in universal grantation ι ‘it
is eoneotly said that all the parts of the world, especially those that have
weight, seelr the oentre, and that this is tha cause of the stabilityof theuni-
verse and ol the earth3 air and fire ere absolutely without weight, still they
have a sort of tendency to the oentre of the universal sphera, though they
naturally gether around its circumferenee’ (γίγνεσθαι ταῦτά σας ἐπὶ τὸ τῆς
ὅλης σφαίρας τοῦ κόσμου με’σον, τὴν δὲ σόστααιν πρὸς τόν πιριφέρειαν αὐτοῦ
ποιεῖσθαι). Compara also passages cited by Zeller 1v pp, 184, 185. The
explanation seems to be that the all-pervading ether, while it has a na
turally expansive and interponetrative force, has aleo a strong oohesive
forne and thus holds all things together around the centra. See below,
on the air, which has in itaelf a tendeney to riso, and yet olings to the
element immediately under it, so es to forbid any vaouum3 and ef. Plut

Luor. 1 1052 foll. Even Plut. (Fac. Orb. L. e. 7) denies it.
