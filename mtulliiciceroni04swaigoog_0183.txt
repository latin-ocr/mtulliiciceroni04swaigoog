fairly be inferred from their never oocmring in any of his tragedias ; though, ,
as the author of the argument prefixed to the Rhesus observes, he was
πολυπράγμων περὶ τὰ μετάρσια ; and though, ifhe had been acquainted with
them, he would assuredly have introduced them into the description of the
πέπλος in the Iora 1148-1158. There however we only find Ἕσπερος,
Illirico, Ὠρέων,,’Ἀρκτος, Ὑάδες, and ’Ἕως φωσφόρος’. 111 the pseudo-Aristo·
telian treatise De Mrardo ‘we find (o. 2) an arrangement of· the whole
system, along witha great variety of names: φαίνων, φαέθων, πυρόεις
and στίλβων οοο111 here, Ι believe, for the first time: perhaps they were
given by Eudoxus, who, Seneca says (N Q. vn 3), primas ab Aegypto
quinque aiteram nactas a'a Graeciam trarratalr't. We are likewise told that
the star of Mars was also termed the star of Hercules, that of Meroury by
some the star of Apollo, that of Venus by some'the star of Juno', ibid.
The descriptiva names are fairly appropriate (of. Plin. H. N. 1116 ξ 79);
Satum is the shining, Jupiter the blazing (φαέθων only used of the sun
in its original sense),Mars thored and fie1y(ofthe Stoic etymology for
'qur=de'paeoa πῦρ, on which see Lydus de Merra. 18 and other passages

twinkling (Simplicius, ap. Brendis Sobel. p. 495 1), notices the twinkling of
Meroury in connexion with its name; of Arist. Cael. 11 8ο11 the reasons
for the twinkling of the stars as opposed to the planeta).

a terra abest plurimum: according to Macrobius S. Sap. 1 20, the
order of the planete, after the furthest three, Satura, Jupiter, Mars, as to
which there was general agreement, was differently determined· by the
Egyptians and chaldeans. The former, followed by Pythagoras (Zeller 1
395), Plato (rim. 38, Nep. x 616), Aristotle (Met. x1 8, cf. Krische ·
Norrctarryea p. 290), Chrysippus (Stob. Ecl. p. 448), made Venus and
Mercury 4th and 5th, the Suu oth, then the Moon, then the Earth The .
latter, followed by Archimedes, Geminus, Cleomedes, Vitruvius, Ptole-
maeus, Hyginus (Grom. p. 184 11), Pliny (H. N. 11 :ra-40), and Cic.
here, placed the Sun above Venus and Meroury. There were great doubts
as to the relative position of these two. Oic. himself, who in this passage
places Mercury furthest from the earth, follows another authority in Dio.
