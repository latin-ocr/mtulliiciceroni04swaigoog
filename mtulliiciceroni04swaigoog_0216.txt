function it is, as superstet, ‘the survivor' (lit. the friend who bends over

the dying man: or had supersto originally the force of supereum? cf. presto),
to do proper honours 16 the dead and carry out his wishes dec. One who
was to an exmusive degree occupied with the thought of the dead and was
held to be in close intercourse with the unseen world was superstitiosus,
either a necromancer end wizard‚ or a foolish believer in ghosts, accord-
ing to the degree oi enlightenmeut in surrounding society.

religiosi ex relegendo : C.’s derivation is supported by the old verse
preserved by Gellius l.e. religemem etse oportet, religiosum mesae, and is
favoured by Curtius s w. λέγω, who compares θεῶν ὄπιν οὐκ ἇλέγοντες
(ll. xV1388); but here too Lactantius (1118) seems to me right, uomeu
religionis u mutulo pietatis esee deductum, quod homiuem eibi Deus religaverit
et pretate coustriuaeritss..meliue erpo (quum Cicero) id uomm Drwretius iuter-
pretatur ert, quie uit religionum se modos ereolmre (1932). See Munro on
Lucr. 1 109, who cites de Domo 105 aid etium muliebribus relipioailue te
implicemur, as proving that O. himself could not help connecting the word
' with the idea of obligation: so we find religione obstriupere (2 Phil. 83); selei
reliyimte (Oueeiuu 98) ; religiouilur ruseeptie impeditur (iu Pir. 58) ; domum
religione 61119616 (p. Domo 106, 124); resoluere religirme Liv. 11120; Numu

turee p. 11) is inclined to prefer O.'s etymology on the ground that there is
no trace of the religious sense in the use ol the verb religare (except in
Lact. l. c.); but it may be replied that neither is ,there in relegere, except in ,
passages which are intended to prove the connexion With these excep-
tions we do not get nearer than Trojuui belli emptorem relegi Hor. epp.

elegantes ex eligendo: Stamm rightly says (p.r 3¹5) that this clause,
which is omitted by some mss and edd· ls needed to justisy the following
cruribus, which could hardly be used of less than three clauses Elegeam
seemsto show that the root 169 had two conjugational forms, astho root
119 must have had if we derive relipio from it: M. Muli lc. compares
lictor and the double forms implied in opium and rebellio by the side
of opimari, rebellari. For the sense cf. electe Iouem 49, electissima uerba

diligentes: 1111196 is ‘to prefer’‚ hence ‘to care for’3 and diliyeue
‘carefu1', ‘attentivc '.
