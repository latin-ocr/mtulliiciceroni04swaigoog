111 times that of the earth (Herschel 5358). Forthe views of other ancient

actia apetiam efficere. Cleomedes professes to give the calculatione of the
latter. In 1 c. 10 p. 52 we have his calculation of the circumference of the
earth from the length of the arc between Rhodes and Alexandria, which he·
finds from observation of the elevation of the star Canopus to be ἡ of the
circle. The length of this arc is taken as 5000 stades3 hence the earth's
circumference will be 240000 stades and its diameter 80000 stades. ’
Again in Bk 11 1 p. 79 we find the words ὑποθέμενος μυριοπλασίονα εἶναι
τὸν ἡλιακὸν κύκλον τοῦ τῆς γῆς κύκλου, ἀπὸ τούτου ὁρμώμενος δείκνυσιν ὅτι
μυριάδων τριακοσίων εἶναι δεῖ τὴν τοῦ ἡλίου διάμετρον, which Delambre.
ἵ paraphrases as follows (1 225), ‘Posidonius calcula que le diametra du Soleil
doit etro de 300 myriades de stades et que ee diametra est au moins 10,000 ·
fois aussi grand que celui de la terre'. But wa have seen that the earth’s
diameter was calculated by Posidonius at 80000 stades, therefore the Sun’s
diameter should be, not 300 myriads (3‚000,000), but 80,000 myriads
(800,000,000) of stades. Delambre would have been saved from falling
into a gross blunder if he had noticed that immediately below (pp. 81, 83)
the phrase ἡλιακὰς κύκλος manifestly refers, not to the circumference, but
to the orbit of the Suu. It is there stated that the Sun's diameter is
ile of his orbit (Archimedes makes it 7735). According to this proportion
the Sun’s orbit should be ’15οκ3000000 stades=2,250,000‚000, which is
not so far from 10000 times the supposed circumferenoe of the earth. It
Ι would appear therefore that Posidonius made the Sun’s diameter 37} times

larger than that of the earth. Cleomedes had heard (φασο that Hipparchus
made it 1050 times that of the earth.

reliquendum: Cleomedes (11 3 p. 96 foll), who mostly follows Posi-

donius, argues that many of the fixed stars must bo as large or even
larger than the sun
