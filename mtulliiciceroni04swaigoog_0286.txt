τροφῆς, so Ochus 1v 1 l 14 (using the word aeneum in the sense of O.'s
αιοιιι) says ιιοιοαοιοι qai imeneorum perimpium eat, newerca a septime
ιρινιαινοιιοιταιααιριι. ’

multiplex et tortuosa: describing the smaller intestines. The same
words are found combined in a metaphorical senso Lael. 65.

arcetque ¹et continet: conjoined in R. P. vr 17 orbe οαιιιαιι arcam cr
wratiaeca οιιοτοι, the former word brings into greater prominence the idea
ofa restraining and limiting force from the outside

calore quem multum habet: cf. above ξ 24. Theophilus Oorp. Heca.
11 4 says that ‘since the stomach needed abundant heat, the Creator
placed near it the liver’ ὥσπερ λέβητα διάπυρον. On the attraction of the
epithet into the relative clause, see Draeg. ξ 474. ·

οι terendo elbo: Madv. omitted cabo; but, clumsy aa the phrase is, we
could hardly dispense with the object here, and the gerund by itself would
come in a little awkwardly between 'the substantivas¹ calore and φιηιιι
Heind reads ca ιονοοιιο, ‘heat arising from the crushing of food' ; but
caer and ιτιιιινα are two distinct causes of digestim, which were opposed
ιο one another by rival medical schools, as we learn from Celsus 1 procace,
draca alil moereas, teri cibran οἰι verare οοοιιοιοιιιναι ,·...αῐιί’ medum Hippo-
crati per coloreo cibos οοιιοοριιι. ’

Oh. nv. raritas quaedam-mollitudo : ‘of a loose and spongy consist-
ency'. Quaedam is added, because raritas was an unusual word, perhaps first
employed by O.: even rueras is generally used of distinct objects rather than
of one loosely constituted whole. The word οροιιριοιιιι is used by Celsus
rv l ριιιινοο ιρονιριοιιιι ideoque spiritu capua, instead, of (l’s periphrasis ;

spumeas: properly used of blowing upon some external object, as
above ξ 83 aspiratio aeria ‘ventilation'‚ here absolute, of an expiration, ·
which would be more properly expressed by a reference to the terminas α
quo, but the word casparo is not found in Caesar or eiu: perhaps its later
connotation unfitted it for use in the literal sense.

tum in respnaeu: Lamb’s emend for tum ia re ιριτίια. The word
respiro is used for the general process of breathing, like ἀναπνεῖν, but also
specially for the return of breath in either direction; as just above we
had respiret et reddat opposed ιο animam ριιαι ducta eat spirita, and again
below ξ 138 redditae respiraverim but here (as in Juv.x1v28 ct coa ter
αιτιοι respiret) of drawing in breath, in response ιο the outgoing breath of
aspirantes. So α’ναπνοή ie¹ opposed to ἔκπνοή in Plato Tim. 79 Ε, Arist
Part. Ara 1113. The corruption of tho nss was hardly ιο be avoided, when
once re had got separated from the rest of the word, not to mention that
respiratus is very rare, apparently only found elsewhere in Apuleius
Madusss emend. acrama ιριτιιιι is unsatisfactory, because it represents the
orgen as passively influenced by the breath coming in of itsell. The
