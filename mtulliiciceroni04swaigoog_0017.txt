Α. The Divina Existence proved (a) from the observation of the
heavans, (b) from general consent, (a) from various recorded epipha-
niae, (d) from the fact of divination. §§ 4—12.

Ab. Further explained. Cleanthes derives the consensus of
belief from four causes (l) presentiments of the future (te. divina·
tion just treated of), (2) the blessings of life, (3) terrible and unusual
phenomena of nature, (4) the order of the heavenly bodies (treated
of under a). ξς 13-15.

Aa Argument of Chrysippus: (1) the universe shows the opera-
tion of superhuman‚ ie. of divine power 5 (2) the universe is too
beautiful to be the habitation of man alone, it implies a super-human
inhabitant. §5 16,17. v

Af Man inhabits the lowest region of the universe; the pure
ether of the-higher regions is fitted for nobler inhabitants § 17.

Ap. Still even inan is gifted with reason, and this, like the
grosser elemento of which his body is composed, must be derived
from the universe, as its source. ᾗ 18.

Ab. The universe being perfect must contain that which is
essential to persertim, viz. mind. ξ 18.
