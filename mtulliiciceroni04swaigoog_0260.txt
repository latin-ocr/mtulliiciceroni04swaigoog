nauta: this hardly gives the αι’νόν ἄγαλμα oi the original It may
have been suggested by the words used just before oi Cassiopeia ἀπόζειν

Cio. Prov. Ooaa 13 hae ἅιιρίὼοο pestes 1111011111 (of the consuls Piso and
Gabinius), but both instantes refer to pairs. Ie there any ease in which it
meane simply ‘two’l Perhaps here we should translate ‘twinned ’. ¹ The
line οεισπιιιια απ aeris—eodum is an ambellishment added by O. We find
aedae used of a oommon star in Ptaeaom. 17 (translating σύνδεσμος), and
(1111111111 similarly used (l. 34 adorno aomina) without anything correspond-
ing to it in the original: the word was also a favourite with Lucretius,
ol his adorno ᾰουίσιω oolam amora, and Munro on 1 402, 476, ola

contortis cum comibus: ‘with orinkled homs’. Aratus 225 αὐτοῦ

passed through this sign was originally connected with fishing. After·
warde a mythologioal explanation was found in the Syrien deity Derceto or
Atargatis, olias Isis or Venus (01. Fosi. 11 458), whom the two fishes are
said to have saved from Typhon

plaoing the Pleiade near the knee ο1 Taurus; they are really at his back,
near the bright stare in the leit foot of Perseus. For the readings see
