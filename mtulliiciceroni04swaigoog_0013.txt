helpful to a scholar, but unfortunately it only comes
down to Eratosthenes; and Rudolf Wolf in his ex-

³ cellent Geschichtc dor Astrooorm'e is only able to allow

a limited space to the Astronomy of the Ancients
While I have been engaged in the study of the
scientific writings of the Old World, it has olten
occurred to me to deplora the neglect into which they
have fallen ‘amongst ourselves. The early guesses of
Greek science exhibit in a most interesting way the
development of the human mind, and they are so

closely connected with the philosophy of their time,

that it is scarcely possible to form a right estimate of
the one without knowing something of the other. Why
might not Cambridge, which has now admitted into
her final classioal school the Art, Philosophy, History
aud Law of the Ancients‚ add to these eleo the Science
of the Ancients ae a new alternative subjectl It would
⁴'be easy to have examinatione in Mathematical and
Biological Science in alternate yeare; and, if in one
year studente were asked to bring up for examination
specified treatises of such authors as Euclid, Archi-
medee, Geminus and Ptolemy, and in another year
portione of Aristotle, Theophrastus, Pliny and Galen,
particularly the Dc Usu Fortium of the laet, I think
it would not only call attention to some very excel-
lent and much neglected writingS, but also provide
a useful link between our literary and cur scientific‘
education.
