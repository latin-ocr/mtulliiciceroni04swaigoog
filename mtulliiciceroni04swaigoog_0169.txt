appetite (ὄρεξις) moves the will, at times the will the appetite, like the
sphere ’, which Trendelenburg explains 01 the highest sphere which carries
round with it all the inferior planetary spheres; the readings however
vary. On the other hand there is 1 curicus passage (Met. x1 10 p.
1075 a) in which necessity seems to be attributed to the movements 01 the
heavenly bodies in contrast to the spontaneous movaments of the inferior
members of the universe, see Grant's comment upon it in his essey on
Arettotte’e Oeaceptioe of Nature. Bernays Dat. Arae. p. 103 foll. thinks
that Aristotle may have spoken 01 the stars having a motion 01 their own
(ἐφ’ ἑαυτῶν)(1103110311011311011031011 which we regard as natural, and
that 0000101301 may have arisen from a confusion between this and ἐφ’
ἑαυτοῖς, ‘a motion depending on themselves'; but the passages cited by
Bywater in the Journal of Philoloyy make it probable that Arist. in his
popular dialogus may have attributed voluntary action to the 03110, and
certainly in the preceding paragraphs 01 3110 N. D. the orderly movements
01 the stars are ascribed to their own intelligcnce, not to any superior

' power.

pondere aut levitate: Arist. believed that there were such qualities
es absolute weight and absolute lightness, Cael. 1v 4 ἔστι τι ἅπλῶς κοῦφον
καὶ enies βαρύ· λέγω δ’ ἅπλῶς κοῦφον ὃ ἀεὶ ἅνω, καὶ βαρὺ ὃ ἀεὶ κάτω πέφυκε
φέρεσθαι μὴ κωλυόμενον· τοιαῦτα γὰρ ἐστι’ τινα, καὶ οὐχ ὥσπερ οἴονταί τινες
πάντ’ ἔχειν βάρος. See the criticism 11111101. 1 1083, 11 184 foll.

in sublime ferri: thiais the reading 01 Orelli's 1100 here and below
5 141, but the edd. have omitted ie in both places. Again in 5 117, where
the edd. read aeblime, the reading 01 the 110010 00111111 01 sublimia We
have however no variation of reading in 5 101 sublime fertur, 5 89 sublime
rapi, 5 65 sublime fusam, Tuae. 1 40 sublime ferri, ib. 102 sublime praesecet,
Die. 1167 0111101311 In thelast two instances it is used without any idea
01 motion. These instances show that the copyists found no difficulty in
the omission 01 the preposition ; so that, unless it is contraryto the Latin
idiom, thera is no occasion to suppose that they have interpolated it here;
and there is no c priora reason against ie sublime more than against ie
altam ,· moreover the lexx. cite many exx. of sublime used with in and other
prepositions.

quorum neutrum contingeret: the 101 would have been more regu-
lar here after the simple relative, but the Subj. 10 sometimes substituted
fer it, see above 5 24 eodm ie 10131110 taeit,1 12 ee qao exstitit with n,
