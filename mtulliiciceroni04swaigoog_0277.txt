The wound of Aeneas is healed with it Aee. ΧΠ 411. Ι have adopted
Allen's emendation sensatis for υιιιιιιαιιι, which was no doubt repeated
from the preceding οοιιιιιαιιι. Nowhere else is there allusion to poisoned
arrows in reference to the dictamnus: its power was supposed to be that
of stanching the blood and oausing the arrow to fall out; also it was used
πρὸς τάς δυστοκίας τῶν γυναικῶν· ἢ γάρ εὐτοκεῖν φασι ποιεῖν ἢ παάειν γε τοὺς
πόνους (Theophr. l. a). Again we never read of poisoned arrows being
used in Crete, but only among barbarous reses, such as the Scythians (see
Ds'ct. os Aet. under scyllam: indeed there could be no use for them in
Crete, as we are expressly told that the island was free from all wild beasts
and noxious animals (see reff. in the art on Orela in Dat. of θυαμ), and

who wera famed for their skill in archery.
