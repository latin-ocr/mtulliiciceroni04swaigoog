5. 6 ὀλίγιστον μέν γὰρ τὸ μελαγχολικὸν περίττωμα, πλέον δ’ αὐτοῦ νδ χολῶδες,

of the ohylc, 55 says that, after its arrival in 555 liver, it throws off two
secretione, yellow and blaok bile, and ascende, having now attained its
ruddy hue, to the upper part of 555 livor, Ur. Part. 1v 4.

adoasdomuue portas jecoris confluunt: this, taken by itself, would
agree with Huxley's account of the ‘portal system' p. 56, ‘the bloodis
distributed throughout 555 livor from 555 acac ρονισι, and thence it is
conveyed by small veins which unite into a large trunk (thehepatic vein)
opening into the inferior 5555 σανα near 555 portal fissura ’.

uncommon with O. to omit the proposition in the second of a pair oi oom-
pounds into which the same proposition enters, ci Madv. fita. 111 36.

according to Plato Tim. 70 ἅμμα τῶν φλεβῶν καὶ ιπηγὴν τοῦ περιφερομένου

the blood originated in the livor and was only distributed from the heart
Galen argues in favour of thie view Ηίρρ. et Plaa p. 531.
