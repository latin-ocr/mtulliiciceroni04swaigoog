01 the left auricle drives it into tho loe ventricle, from whence it pasees
· into tho corta, andis carried through its branchos into all parts of the
body. The ancients believed that the right ventricle‚ called by them
αίριιτική, supplied the veins with the blood which it received from the
0000 αααα,· and that the left ventricle‚ called πνευματική, supplied the
arterias with the air received from the lunge (Galen Ur. Part. vl 7). The
course of the airis thus described by Theodoret Paua p. 514 Scho‘ πνεύ-

salutas per mitae: secun on 11240101 136. AccordingtoSprengel
(1 p. 491) Praxagoras (11 300 ac.) first noticed the distinction between
arterias and veins ; in the genuine works 01 Arist both are confounded
under the name φλέβες. The reason why it was thought that they con-
tained air was that after death they wore found empty while the veins
were filled with the retmning blood. Galen, while explaining the stronger
textina 01 the arterias as compared with the veins, hcm the supposed fact
that the former were intended es channels for varying amounts 01 air,
while the latter had only 10 convey a uniform amount 01 blood, still held

that there was a certain proportion 01 highly rarefied blood in tho arterias,
and 01 condensod air in the veins (Ua Part. vr 10, and 10). It was not

. till 1630 an. that the true doctrine 01 the circulation 01 the blood was

discovered hy Harvey.
