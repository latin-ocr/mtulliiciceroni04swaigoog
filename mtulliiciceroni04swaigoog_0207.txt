ζ 111 etymology given by L. and S. ;¹ Ι prefer the more common one sup·
ported by Preller and Buttmann, which regards it as another 1111111
11111111,·111111111 with Ζεύς and 11111 (111 below on Diaua); but they seem
11 be mistaken in attributing this derivation 11 Nigidius Figulus (ap.

deue claudat. Nigidius here distinctly says the d is otiose and added
merely 111 the sake 11 euphony‚ 1ο that he may very well have concurred
with O.’sde1ivation. The chief objecticn to this latter is that it would
make the original attribute 11 the deity simply to preside over deors, whereas
he is the old Latin god 111111 sky, styled oleorum deus in the ancient
hymns 11 the Salii, and the learned augur Messala, who was consul 53 Β. 1.,
writes 11 J anus as 1111 god qui cauata fiupit 1111111111 repit, aquae terraeque

Roman Exchange, the arcade with four arches in the forum, where merchants
used to meet. Jauaa is distinguished 11111 arcus by its length, fromforuia
as being essentially pervious. Preller thinks it was named from the god,

Buttmann, as a perfectly distinet word, derived (as O. says) from ire, and
merely associated ¹with the godet first 11111 similarity 11 sound; after-
wards etymologists discovered such connecting links as we read in the

importance: he has finished with lanus, and introduces Vesta as pre-
siding over the end. ‘So much for Janus; as 111 Vesta she is a Greek
goddess’. On the elliptioal use 11 uam in lists 11 names 111111 27,
