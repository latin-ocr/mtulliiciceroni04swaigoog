always spoken ef in the highest terms by Oia, who is followed by Horace
(0110101110ηο (1191), but charged with ambition and corruption
by Sallust The authority which he exercised is shown by a striking
anecdota. Being aoeused by the tribune, Varius, of exciting the allies to
revolt, he deigned ne ether reply than Q. Varias Hispanae M. Scaurum

’ Atilius Oalstlnus triumphed 0101· the Carthaginians in the first

Plane. 60. We read (109. 11 98) that he dedicated a temple to Spes, and
hence Lambinus followed by Heind reads Spes instead 01 the 91111 Fater,
because Spa, which is mentioned in 111 61 (but not below§ 79) ought not
te be omitted here, and because Numa was the first builder 01 the temple 01

refer to the same.

virtum: there were two temples at Reme te Heeos and Virtus oom-
bincd; ene near the perte Capena, dedicated originally te Honos by
Fabius Ormoteter rac. 933, in consequence ef a victory ever the Ligurians:
this was afterwards enlarged by Marcellus ‘the swerd 01 Rome ’, and ‘dedi-
cated to the two divinities 10 whom his life was consecrated’ (Mommsen).
He had vowed it first in the battle at Clastidium 110. 999, where he wen
the spelm opime by slaying the Gallio king, anda second tima during the
siege 01 Syracuse. The temple was finally dedicated by his sen 905 ae.
and adorned with troasures 01 art from¹ Syracuse (Verr. 11 191, 193, Liv.
Ι 11111 95, xm 11): among ether things we read 01 the sphera ef Ar·
chimedes being placed there (R. P. 1 14). The second temple was erected
by Marius en the Oapitol in commemorationes his victorias ever the Cimbri
and Teutone (Soet. 116 with Halm’s n., Burn p. 193, Preller p. 613). Later
a separate temple was built te Virtus by Scipio the Younger‚ and ene 10
Heraea, mentioned loy. 11 68.
Ι multis: es only eleven years intervened between the dedication by
Fabius and the vew at Clastidium, and only twenty-eight years between
the earlier and later dedication, and as Fabius and Marcellus were too well
known fer 0. to have fergetten thet they were contemporaries, we ought
perhaps to alter the reading 01 the mss by the insertion of the negative.
