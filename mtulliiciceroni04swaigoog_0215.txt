W* and S. consider it to denote originally ‘a standing still over or bya
thing; hence amazement, wonder, dread': Grimm D. M. p. 1059 00111-
ppares it to uberqiaube (ider-plaute) implying 0 persistent holding to extra·
vagant beliefs which were abandoned hymen of sense: Nettleship J. os
Ptit. VI p. 98 thinks that it meant originally ‘being present 01 (00111ρο10
1100000100 111 the sense 01 ‘witness ') and hence knowledge 01 0 thing erpon-
dering over a thing '. He quotes passages in which superstitiosus seems tc
imply prophetie knowledge, as Plaut Ampb.1 1. 17011110 terto superstitiosus

reflexion'3 and cites the Gr. ἐπίσταμαι as illustrating the etymology sug-
gested. I must 00111000 I prefer 10 any 01 these the 3rd explanation given
by Lact. 1v 28. After condemning O.'s 0010001010 continues superstitimi

ed uut ii qui superstitem memoriam defurmtmum colum, 001 qui pareatibus

same origin 01 superstition is asserted in Wisdom x1v 15 ‘a father afflicted
with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image 01 his child
soon taken away, now honoureth him as a god, which was then 0 dead
man, and delivered to thosethat were underhim ceremonias and sacrifices’.
This doctrine 01 ι011111110111’, as it is called by Tylor, Herbert Spencer and
others, evidently had a firm hold 01 the early Romans, as shown in their
worship of the Lares and 01101 Marses, in the Normdiate, Feralia and Pa·
rentalia, cf. 010. Lep. 11 55, 57, Laei. 13 (uestri majores) qui mortuis tam
religiosa jura tribueruut, and the saying ot Cato in Plut. vol. 111 p. 411
Didot ‘the proper sacrifices to parents are 1101 lambs or kids, but the tears
of 0110111100 ’. With regard to the actual formation ο1 the word Nigidius
Figulus ap. Gell. 1v 9 maintains that the termination -osus always implies
avicious esoces, 00 111 the words rimosus, mulierosus, uummosus. Gellius

such as victoriosus, formosus ,· and a glanae at the list in Roby (ir, ξ 813
10 enough to show that there is really no special ethical character attach-
ing to adjectives 01 this formation. Still there is the 1001 that one who
spoke the language had such a feeling about this class 01 words, and there
can be no doubt as to the particular word superstitiosus, that it was used
