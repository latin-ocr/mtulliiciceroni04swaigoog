dorus and a 3rd from Panaetius. In order 10 see what grounds
there are ior this opinion we must examine more minutely the
structure 01 110 book. It is divided, as shown in the analysis, into
four parts (1) 110 proof 01 110 Divine Existence, (2) 110 nature 01
the Gods, (3) Providentia] government 01 110 world, (4) Providential
care ior man. But the slightest examinationis sufficient 1ο 0100
1101 these divisione overlap, that much for instance 01 110 101 acation,
eg. Zeno's argument ior the divinity 01 110 universe (§§ 20-22) and
the argument 101· 110 divinity oi the stars (§§ 39-44), would more

naturally come under the and, and much 01 110 3110011133-
⁹ 153 might just as well come under the 411. Moreover there are
actual repetitions, as on the divinity 01 110 stars (§§ 54, 55 compared
with ξς 39-44); and we seem 10 have a double beginning ior the

esse), which has misled, as I think, both Hirzel and Schweneke to
commence the 411 0001100 01 § 133. Ι1 appears 10 me however that
these difficulties arise mainly from want 01 care, on the partui (licere,

as seen in the analysis, seems to me 1ο hold well together, if (1)
