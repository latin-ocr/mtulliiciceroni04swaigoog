Jena 1875, Hartselder Dia Quoties c. Ciceros ‘de Dicirrotioae,'
Freiburg 1878. Βο1 the strongest argument lor the Posidonian ⁵
authorship of the original which Cicero here follows, is to be found
in an examination 01 the book itself, in the agreement between the
opinions there expressed, and opinions elsewhere attributed to Posi-
donius, sometimes in opposition to, or in contradistinction from,
other writers of his school.

The main points 01 distinction between Posidonius and the Stoice
in general appear to bave been (1) his easy and flowing style and
general literary testes, (2) his wide scientific interest, (3) his admira·
tion for Plato and Aristode, and his modification of the older Stoic
doctrines so as 10 bring thern more inte accordanee with the Academic
and Peripatetic doctrines. As to (1) we are told by Strabo 111 2,
§ 9 Ποσειδώνιός ov’r α’πέχεται τῆς συνηθοΰς ῥητορείας, c’hhd συνεν-
dossa ταῖς ὕπερβολαΐς, which agrees with what we read in § 20 01
our book, hamram uberius disputantur ct sacius, ut milri· eet in
animo facere, facilius effugiunt Academicorum calaresium ‚· so Galen ¹
tells us (Hipp. 01 Phe. p. 399 Κ.) that Posidonius was iu the habit
01 relieving his philosophioal discussions with illustratione from the
- poete and historiens, which again is quite in accordance with the
speech of Balbus; compare, for historicel illustration, §§ 6-11 on
divination, ᾗ 61 on apotheosis, ξ 69 on the office 01 Lucina, § 165 on
particular providences3 for poetical quotations compare § 4 and § 65

from Ennius on the divinity 01 ¹the heavens3 from Euripides on the ’

same subject § 653 from Attius, illustrating the theistic argument
srom the impression produced by the sight of the first ship §89 ;
from Aratus 'describing the constellations ἕξ 104-114; from
Aratus again on the Golden Age ξ 159. We need not suppose
that all these exactly correspond to quotations in the original.
Cicero has no doubt given at times examples froin Roman history
instead of Greek history ; and Posidonius had not Oicero's temptation
, 10 tex the attention 01 his readers with long quotations from Aratus.
,Ic may be said however that, whatever his authority, Cicero's
natural teste would have led him to rhetorical treatment of his .
subject: and this is certainly true. On the other hand, it must be
remembered that community of teste would naturally lead him 10
select Posidonius in preference to other Stoica I do not however

lay so much stress-on this point as on those which I have neat
to deal with.
