ipsa onim: ‘lor it is just the carth's shadow, which makes night’, ic. it ι
is no more than this, a mere negative result of the sun's action. I think
afficientia suits better this minimizaticn of activity.

eadem est aequabilitas: ‘there is the same evenness (regularity)
in the nightly as in the daily courses; and the same sun tempers the
degrees of heat and cold by neither departing too far nor approaching
too near’. Ο. is of course inaccurate in saying that summer is caused by
the greater proximity (οοοοοονο) oi the earth to the sun: isse, au the earth
would have summer at the same time, but when the south pole is turned
towards the sun, the northern hemisphere is in winter, when the northern
is turned towards him we have summer, as in fact we read below inflectens
carram acl repteartorwa &a cf. Vitr. rx 1 ξ 13.

circumitus orbium: the words sparta, carras, orbis, cerauniam may all
be used in the same sense, but here circ. means the actual traversing oi
the path (aba) of the sun, ci. itm. 9 aaa et dies...aaam arcuatas

trecentorum, but the edd. apparently agree in taking them as Nominativcs.
Ithink, i‘f it were so, we should probably have had the Sing. aba, ‘365
jomneys over tha sun’s path'3 and that the us reading gives the true

sense ‘the traversings oi 365} diurnal rounds complete the round of the
year', i. e. if we follow the sun’s track throughout these diurna] revolutione,

we shall find that while each day's course is different, yet at the end of the >

year he has completed the circuit of the heaven and returned to the point
from which he originally started.
