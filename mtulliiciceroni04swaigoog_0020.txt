ob. Providential government inferred from a considerationes
'she Divino nature: (1) It is apert oi our idea of God thethe should

, be active, and active in the noblest way, and consequently in regard

to the noblest object, ie. the universe: (2) if he is not so, then he

, must be inferior to some other power which rules the universe; but

such inferiority contradicts the very definitior of Deity ; therefore
¹ he cannot be subject to any other power3 therefore he must rule the
universe himself: (3) the Gods form a community, ond it is natural
to suppose that they possess those same social virtues, which we
believe that we have derived from them; but that they possess them
in higher perfectiori and manifest them on a vester scale in the great

displayed in the universe and the heavenly bodies and agree that

these are divine, we confess that all things are ordered by divine
Providenoe. §eve-80.

Oc. Providential government inferred from the consideration

explained as the result of intelligenoe. Nature exhibite a skill
infinitely beyond the resch of art, but even art testifles to the exim-
ence and intelligence of the artist. If the orrery attests the wisdom
of Archimedes, much more must the movements of the heavenly
bodies attest the wisdom of the Creator. (4) The absurdity of
attempting to explain the universe as the result of the fortuitous
eoncourse of atoma (5) Oustom blinds men, or they could not fail

to acknowledge that the wonders of nature are the works of God.

dd. A detailed review ofthe wonders of nature. (l) The earth
and other elementa (ξ 98-101. (2) The sun, moon, and planete.

§§102, 103. (3) The constellatione. §eloe-115. (4) The several
parts of the universe are held together bya strong centripetal force,
which is the cause of warmth and light to all‘things, and out of
which all are developed anew in the cyclical regeneration (ξ 115-

rnotest parts of the universe, aud our earth is benefited by a stellar
