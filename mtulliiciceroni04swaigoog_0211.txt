from it exx. of frigidity (τὸ ψυχρόν), not unlike that in the text, eg. ‘it
was natural that the instrument of divine rengeance on the mutilators of
the Hermae should be Hermocrates'. Cic. prsises his learning and copious-
ness (Orat. 1158), but is not an admirer of the Asiatio style which he
practised, cf. Brnt. 325 yeneno Asictr‘cne dictionis duo earn, nnnrn centonio·
snm, et argutum, conontiis non tum providus et ιαυυυίς qnam concinnis et
υιιιιιιιίς, quoin in intona Tinaoene. Of Hegesias, a professor of the same
Asiatic school, to whom the saying in the· text is attributed by Plutarch
' (Alce. 3) Cic. speaks even more severely (Brnt. 206) qnid ert tam fractum,
tan evinctum, tarn in insa, qnam tomen consequitur, concinnitate punito?
These passages prove that concinne need not be taken to imply very high
praise, any more thau our ‘neat saying' or ‘pretty couceit'. Plutarch, in
telling the story, himself outdoes the frigidity of Hegesias, Ἠγ. increpuim-
κεν ἐπιφώνημα κατασβέσαι τὴν πυρκαίαν ε’κείνην άπὸ ψυχρίας δυνάμενον·
είκότιος γάρ ἔφη καταφλεχθῆναι τὸν νεῶν τῆς Ἀρτέμιδος άσχολουμένης περὶ
, τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου μαίωσιν.

partu Olympiadis: the Dat. Olympiadi might have seemed more
natural with adesse, but μανίαι is often used with a Genitive of the mother
in this sense, eg. mc Romae tennit ponne Tulliae, Fam. VI 18.

Venus: Arnobius (111 33) follows O. in his absurd derivatiou: itis
probably connected with nenia ‘ graoe', ‘favour'‚ veneror, Sans. ennii ‘wish'.
Varro L. L. v 62 derives it from cincio cieo.

ex ea venustas: sc. nominatur, see Index under Ellipeie.

Oh. xxvn1 ξ 70. videtisne-levitatis: the account here given of
the pagan mythology was eagerly caught up by Christian writers, und the

formae deorum: the Stoics are laughed at (1 24) forheheving in round
gods, but really they assign no form to their highest divinity, the sll per-
vading ether. Thus we are expressly told that Posidonius held God to be
πνεῦμα νοερὸν καὶ πυρῶδες, oris ἕχον μὲν μορφὴν, μεταβάλλον δὲ εἷς ὃ βούλεται
καί συνεξομοιούμενον πᾶσιν (Stob. Eoi, 1 2); so that Lactantius is right (dc
Ira 18) in saying Stoici neyanl habere nilons formant Dennn see Philod p.
84 Gomp. ‘the Stolos do not worship the same gods as others ’‚ ἀνθρωποει-
δεῖς γάρ οὐ νομίζουσιν, ἀλλ’ άέρας καὶ πνεύματα καὶ αἰθέρος. On what follows
see the Epicurean speaker 1 42, here agreeing with the Stoic.
