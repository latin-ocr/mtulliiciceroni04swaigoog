ordiam, magnam amaeam optimatem ινιτιιιιιιιι de eie spate rebus, qaue tum
aporeverentiam ιιι tempore (see n. iu Reid's ed); the Subj. is that of
indefinite repetition after the Inf.; agebantw would necessarily refer to a
single occasion. [ΜΓ Roby writes “I think that, where a short relative
clause constituting a definition of an existing person or thing is used as
the subject of the sentence, Cicero would employ the Iudicative, notwith·
· standing its dependence on a subjunctive, as below ξ 50 quibas pubescant
qaae om'antar a terro, and in Off. 1 51 ot qaae discerpta eunt...teaeuntor‚
ib. 89 at ii qui praeeunt rei publicae...eimilee sint, 98 efficitur ut et ettad
qaod ad οιιιιιιιιι Ιιιιιιιιιαιιιιι pertinet,..appareat. I should therefore prefer
either to read αἰιιιιιιιτ and ardeant here, or to translate ‘which are to be
fed aud grow''’. It seems to me that a writer would use either Mood
according to his feeling at the moment. He might have the class before

. , him as a fixed and definite conception, irrespeotive of the changing indi·

viduals of which it is composed, and of the particular character of the
proposition in which it is included. In that case he uses the Indicative,
but otherwise the Subjunctive. 0. combines them below ξ 44 (Aristotelea)

(cf. below 111 35) and An'st. (though the latter usually prefers the word

by 0, is aa follows: ‘life depends upon movement ; this movement is
connected with the internal heat ; when heat goes, life departs' ; cf. Seneca
