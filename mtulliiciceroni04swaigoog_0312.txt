ξ 159. ad aratra extrahenda: Soh. and Mi'a read trahenda after
Ernesti. Ι think the compound may have been preferred by (lic. partly to
prevent the juxtaposition 01110 110, and partly to express the action 01 the
oren in pulling the ploughshare through deep clay; but apparently 110 pa-
rallel has been found 101 11110 use. There is something rather harah in
the omission 01 runt with 110100.

ouibus cum terrae subigerentur 11001000 1101010011 I agree with
Ba. in taking 0011101 as Abl. 01 Instrument, and strenue as Abl. 01 Μο0001
after 1011900001. Other edd. put a comma after 001110, thus making it a
Dat. govemed by offerebatur. But the important thing is to state that the
oren were the instrumente employed to break up the land; ‘since the
landa were ploughed by them, no violence was used towards them ’. It is
easy to supply the Dat. 01 1110 Demonstrative 01101 aff. (see n. on 1 12) ; 01
possibly, as Wytt. suggests, the ambiguous form quibus may have been
intended todo double duty.
