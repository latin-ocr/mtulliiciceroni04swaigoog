had used for it the name Eridamm, of which he says (l 149) barte oaaa

Vincla: Arai. 362 Δεσμοὶ δ” ουράνιοι τοῖς ’lydis ετ ἅκροι ἔχονται, ἄμφω
συμφορέονται ἀπ’ ονραι ’ων κατιόντες (ι hanging from their baiis '.)

αἰωρεῖται, The Altar was an invention of Eudoxus, which the mythologists
made out to be that on which the Gods swore alliance against the Titane.

chelis: the constellation formerly known as the (llaws of the Scorpion
was afterwards changed to Libra. In Dio. 11 98 it is called dayam, iajago
cara essct laco. Virgil has both names, Chelae in Oea. 133 and Libra l. 208
labra die somnique parea 'aba' fecerit toras, et medicare laci atque ambria
jam dicat orbem, referring to the autumnal eqrrinox, when the sun is in
Libra. Manilius calls it jaya Chelarum 1 609. After the astronomical
reform of J ul. Caesar the name Libra is the one in ordinary use, eg. Hor.

to be the scale of the Virgin J ustice.

hle: the centaur, supposed to be Chiron. porgens : the contracted
form becomes regular in sergo.

quadrupes: now known as Ιονριιι, but not specially named by the
Greeks, as G. says in the line which follows in Ριαοιι. 212 (omitted here)

truculentus caedit: the weight of ns authority is about equal for
cedit or caedd, butI think the probability is in favour of the latter,
because (l) we should otherwise have cedd-tardit—ocdit all meaning the
same thing (for tradat can hardly be taken in the sense of ‘stretoh' with
porgens just before), (2) the idea of sacrifice is naturally suggested by the
altar, (3) the word tractabatur, which does not occur in the original, seems

to have been added by Oic. to suit aaut rather than cedat.
