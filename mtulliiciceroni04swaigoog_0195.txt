times with Rhea'the mother ofthe gods. She had a temple on the Capitol

Liv. xxxix 22, 000 Preller p. 417. Here she is regarded es synonymous
with wealth. Quid: ‘why should I mention her temple'i

Salutis: originally a Sabine goddess whose shrine was on the Quirinal.
A temple was dedicated 60 her, as presiding over the safety 06 Rome, in
the Samnite War 302 aa„ and decorated by Fabius Pictor (Preller
p. 601). ,

Concordiae: her chief temple was built 1)) Camillus on the slope 06
the Capitol 00. 367, after the passing 06 the Licinian laws 60 establish
harmony betweenthe patricians and plebeiam. This was enlarged by
Opimius 121 ac. aiter the overthrow 06 C. Gracchis (Aug. C. 11111 25) and
, again restored 1)) the emperor Tiberius. It was here that the senate often
met. A brazen shrine 06 Concord was erected by Flavius near the Senate·
house in 303 sc. to commemorate his attempt to assert the rights of the
plebs. There was another chapel 06 Concord on the Arx, dedicated by
L. Manlius to commemorate the suppression 06 0 mutiny at the beginning
06 the 2nd Punic War; see Burn 64, 90 6011, 194, Preher 623.

Libertatis: there was a temple of L. on the Aventina built by Grac·
chus, father 06 the victor 06 Beneventum, in which the latter placed a
pictura 06 himself proclaiming the freedom 06 the volunteer eleves who had
fought under him (Liv. xxiv 16). We also read of an atrium 16606060, see
Preller p. 616, Merkel praefi to Ov. Fasti p. cxxx. Clodius dedicated the
house 06 the exiled Cicero to Libertas (Dora. 110).

Victoriae: cf. Preller‘609, Lag. 11 28 ‘if we are tc invent names 06
gods, let us avoid such as Febris and rather choose those Vicae Potae
06060 Statue 0006066600υο 660600·ἰο et Iarioti Joozs, rotantque eapetmdorwm
606660, Sabata, Honores, Opts, Victordae’. L. Postumius dedicated a
temple to Victory in the Samnite war 294 nc. (Liv. x 33). Hiero 000660
Rome a golden 060600 06 victory aiter the battle 06 Cannae, which was
gratefully accepted by the senate and placed in the temple 06 Jupiter on
the Capitol (0660666 ornetque campere, 0001066060 eise dirae ctare dicare
Capitolium, temptam Joar'a 0. M.; a'a 00 0600 orbis 61060600 sacratam
60106606) 6066606060, firmam ac stabilem fore populo 1606060 Liv. xxii 37).
Augustus placed in the Senate-house an altar and statue 06 Victory‚ which
were afterwards regarded 00 the palladium 06 the state. The removal 06
the altar by Gratian gave rise 60 0 famous disputa between Symmachus
and St Ambrose.

regi non possea: this is scarcely the description we should have
expected 06 such abstractione 0060160 and Oortcordia. As was said above,
C. probably applies to them what belongs to the personified passions which
follow. Even then aiae deo regi 10 hardly a suitable expression. The
supernatural character 06 these passione is suggested by the 6006 that
man 60010 himself evermastered by them,' that they seem something dis·
tinet from his own personal being; not because they demand the control
06 0 god.
