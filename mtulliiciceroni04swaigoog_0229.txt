neon 11 cn. xxxrv §86 ’199

quodsi mundi partes ustura administrantur: we have had the
same thing said at the beginning of ξ 83 and of ξ 86.

quod effici optimum potuit: wc find this admissiones a necessity
limiting the action of Providence‚ both in Chrysippus (πολὺ τὸ τῆς ἀνάγκης
μεμῖχθαι, 011 which Plutarch remarks that, if so, οὕτε κρατεῖ πάντων ὁ θεός,
οὔτε πάντα κατὰ τὸν ἐκείνου λόγον διοικεῖται St. liep. 37) and in Seneca, Prot).

derttic, ut dicit Chrysippus et Clecttthes, altit praetermisit pertinentiam ool

rec maadi, co modo sumpsisset compositionem, Galen Ua Part. 111 14 εἶναι γάρ
τινα λέγομεν ἀδύνατα φύσει, καὶ τούτοις μηδ’ ἐπιχειρεῖν ὅλως τὸν θεόν, ἀλλ’ ε’κ τῶν
δυνατῶν γενέσθαι τὸ βέλτιον αἱρεῖσθαι, Philodemus π. θεῶν διαγωγῆς col. 8
Vol. Herc. v153(Zeller1v 178) ‘the Stoice while they ossign all power to
God'‚ ὅταν ὑπὸ, τῶν ἐλέγχων πιέζονται, τότε καταφεύγουσιν ἐπὶ τὸ διὰ τοῦτο
φάσκειν τὰ συναπτόμενα (what is fitting) μὴ ποιεῖν, ὅτι οὗ πάντα δύναται. 011
the Stoic theodicy generally see Zeller p. 173 foll, and compare the doc-
trine maintained by Leibnitz Theoti. 1 ξ 8 ‘il demeure toujours vrai qu'il
y a une infinite dc mondes possibles dont ilfaut que Dieu ait choisi le
meilleur, puisqu'il nc fait rien sans agir suivant la supreme raison'; also
J. S. Mill’s Tleism Pt 2, where he argues in favour of the hypothesis
of a benevolent Creator ‘working under the limitation (quod potuit) of
inexorable lawr and indestructible properties of matter '.

ξ 87. ergo : clliptical, ‘you dcny itl Thon let some one show abetter ’.
Cf. ξ 77 erpo utrem ipsoram, and the ellipticel force oi ἐπεί with Im· ’
perative. .
potuisse melius: compare the famous saying of Alphonso of Castile
(A. n. 1252), ‘If the Creator had consulted me, the world would have been η
construeted one simpler and better plan' (than that of Ptolemy). Theory ¹
is put in place of lact, and the supporters of the theory require it to be
accepted as perfect and divine. St Paul takes a different view ol the
existing order of nature: with him ‘the whole creation is groaning and
travailing together, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God ².
'And a philosopher like Butler does not pretend to maintain the perfection-
of the order of natureae it is at present known to us: hc only asserta
that we do not know enough to pronounce positively thet it is imperfect
, [potuerit : eompleted future indicative.¹ Θυνοί potuerit is to desicicrobit
what qaod potuit would be to desiderat. Both denote what could not ,
have taken place before the time of the principal verb. Cicero says ‘any
fancied improvement will be either a deterioration or an improvement
precluded by the nature of things ². Poterit would be out of place here
as it would denote a subsequent time. Qeodyieri ιιοιι poterit, fecere cocc-
bitwr woulddescribe the impotency of a constructor: qaod ficri ιιοιι
potuerit, daidcromt reproves the vanity of the critic. ‘Hc will be rc-
gretting the absence of that, which could not possibly have been there ’. Β]
