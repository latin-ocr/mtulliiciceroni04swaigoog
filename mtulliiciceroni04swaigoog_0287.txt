cibus animans—ammanus: ‘that aeria] nutriment which is the
chief support of animal lire ’, cf, Hippoo. de Blae. 4 ‘the body is sustained
by three kinds of nutriment σῖτα ποτὰ πνεύματα, of which the last is by fer
the'most important’. Arist. denies this (Reap. 6) ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ τροφῆς
γε χάριν ὑποληπτέον γίνεσθαι τὴν ἀναπνοὴν air τρεφομένου τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ ε’ντὸι·

' πυρός...μὸλλον γὰρ ἐκ τῆς τροφῆς (ordinary foed) τοῦτο γινόμενον ὁρῶμεν : ibe
only useis ιο coel the heart. Galen (Ua Part. vn 9) on the other hand
considers that the chief fimetion of respiration is to keep up the vital heat
by constant supplies of fresh air, and indly ιο feed the vital spirit (τὸ
ψυχικὸν πνεῦμα). The word ιιιιιι is used below 111 37 of the exhalatione on
which the stare feed, and we find the metaphorica] citas ιιννιοιπιιοιιι

§ 137. Cicero's account of the process of digestion is very incorrect-
The following is a summarp¹ of what is said in Huxley's Physiology on the
subject The food when ithae passed into the stomach is changed by
continual rolling about with constant additions of gastric juice, intoa
fluid called οιροιι, of which a considerable portion is absorbed through the
walls of the vessels of the stomaoh into the current of the blood, which is
rushing through the gastris veins to the aena portae. The remainder of'the
cayna passos into the (ιιιοοίονιινοι, where it is mixed with bile and pancreatic
juice and becomes clyto. In its passage through the smaller intestines the
greater portion of this is again carried off through the capillaries into the
blood vessels: the remainderis absorbed by the lactea] vessels, and conveyed
through these ιο the mesenteric glande, and thence to the thoracic duct,
where it is compounded with lymph. Itis then carried ιο the subelavian
vein, which sendsthe blood into the right side of ‚the heart. From thence
it is eonveyed by the pulmonery artery to the lunge, where itis converted
xinto arterial blood. See diagrams in Huxley or elsewhere.

a medio intestino: a mistranslation of the Gr, μεσεντέριον, which is
not properly an intestine at all, but a membrano interposed between the
intestines (ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐντέρων, Arist. says H. A. 116), ‘a fold of the peri·
toneum which suspende the small intestines to the back wells of the
abdomen ², Huxley L c. p. 36. It is however classed among the-intestines

portas jecoris: the ‘portal fissure' where the aena ροιιοιο, the hepatia ,
artery and the great nerves enter the liver. Galen (Ua Part. 1v 1) tells us
that after the stomach has cleared away the grosser particles, it sends the
chyle ιο ιιι liver (κοινὸν ὅλοι τοῦ ζῴου πέψεως χωρίον), the entrance to
which, being divided into many narrow passages, hes received the name

and approved by Hippocrates and the sect of the Asclepiade. (Itis used
