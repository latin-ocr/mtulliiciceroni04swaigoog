ab its: the latestedd. treat'these words as an interpolation. It seems

to me more difficult to explain their insertion, if they did not form part oi ¹
' the original text, than to justify their use. If a general word, such as

cannata referring to the first creation of man, had preceded, some such ’
phrase as this would have been required with the Passive verbs following 3
but even when a word of particular application like consoletis appears in
the Abi. Abs. its subject may be repeated with a different government
afterwards, see Sch. opole. 111 373, who cites among other exx. Caes. B. G.
ΙΠ 14 tnnlbne cantatis tamen boa altitudo puppium superabat, instead oi
torrerenn'tctns. Itis more remarkable to find the AbI. of the Agant, not
of the instrument, used in regard to the teeth, but this sort of personifica-

· tion may be paralleled by α linquo in the next sentence, and by§ 139
neruos ο qulbus artas continentur, ξ 144 cuddae α qno cnm sonna est eccep-
tne. Sch, would transpose ab its before atqle, scas to connect them with
manditur ; but the reading constrictis sufficiently explains the action of
manditur, and I think they come in more naturally introducing extenuatur
&c as a sort of second thought.

extenuatur: cf. Plin xvm 43 in pnlnnnn extenuari.
eorum adversi [acuti]: I think nenti should either be expelled asa
gloss or be altered into acuto. The double epithet would imply that some
frent teeth were not sharp. They are called πρόσθιοι by Arist. Η. Α. 11 l
ᾗ 50, and Part. An. 111 1 ὁ δ’ ἅνθρωπος ἔχει τοὺς μὲν προσθίους ὀξεῖς ἵνα
διαιρῶσι, τοὺς δὲ γομφίους πλατεῖς ἵνα λεαίνωσιν, primores by Plin. N. H.

ουσίαν.
reruni: (onan γένος, ‘chin ²), called also mundiores and emtores. Of.
Xen. Mem. 14 ξ 6 τοὺς μὲν πρόσθεν ὀδόντας πᾶσι ζῴοις οἵους τέμνειν εἶναι, τοὺς
δὲ γομφίους οἵους παρὰ τούτων δεξαμένους λεαίνειν. confectio : ‘masti-
cation'.

(the trachea), τελευτᾷ δὲ διὰ τοῦ διαζώματος (the diaphragm) εἶς τὴν κοιλίαν,
ie. itis the oesophagus or alimentary canal Hippocrates often uses it for
the neck or upper portion cf any orgen: in later times, es by Meletius Nat.
Hotn. c. 18, it is used for the stomach in our sense (ἡ ἅνω κοιλία) as distin
guished from the oesophagus on the one hand, and the intestines (ἡ xire
κοιλία) on the other. cf. Theophilus Cotp. Han. 112 with Greenhill's
note.
tonsillas: apparently so called from impeding the passage of foed,
tonsilla being used for the stake to which a boat was fastened, see Festus
.v. In Greek they were known as παρίσθμιο or, when swolien, as
όντιόδες.
