11 is said that Tiberius shewed his pride by walking mmeemyrdn et obetrpa,
Ernesti argues that it must mean ‘bent back '‚ and that the word does not
necessarily imply more than ‘stiffiy bent’ in whatever directim, Appa

writers Isbould translate therefore ‘the head is slanted, thrown back from
the shapely neck ; you would say it fixed its gaze 011 the tail of tlre Great
Beer ’. Ι see no reason for changing thea cervice of the uss either into 00
ceroma with Sub, or (still less) into at 00101οο with Madv. ; the head 'rs'simply
bent away from the line 01 the neck. 'l'he line is imitated by 11101135

mistaken the force 01 aedom, the first translating dedice caput (l. 61), the
second ira 001001 curvata (l 156), but there is no reason to suppose these
equivalent to G's obseptae, as Forcellin'r We may compare Vitruvius’ de

ξ 108. totls noehbus: see above § 105. reliquum quidem corpus:
opp. to the following 1100 caput.
hoc caput: Ο. 10 fond ο1 this rather clumsy demonstrative, which is
' here however justified by 1110 Greek (l. 61) κείνη που κεφαλὴ τῇ νήχεται, ᾗχι
περ ἄκραι μίσγονται δύσιές τε καὶ ἀντολαὶ ἀλλήλῃσιν. Hipparchus ‚explains
this 10 mean that 1110 head, the most southern part of the constellation,
· being precisely 37⁰ from the pole, just touches the horizon in the latitude
01 Athens. It thus skims 1110 aurfaoe of the ocean (the poetic word 101
horizon) at the point where its settings and risings meet. If 11 were
further from the polethe risings and 'settings would be separated by an
interva13 if 1100101, there would be no setting; but it is ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀεὶ φανεροῦ
κύκλου, which among 1110 Greeks was called the Arctic circle, of course
varying with the latitude: the Antaretic oirole was ὁ ἀεὶ ἀφανὴς κύκλος.
Hipp. would not have approved of G's translation of Aratus, for, in opposi-
. tion tc a commentator named Attalus, he expressly says οὐ δύνει βραχὺν
χρόνον καὶ ἀνατελλειι so the pseudo-Eratosthenes speaks of the Δράκοντος
κεφαλή ae being on the horizon.
subito aequore condit τ Grotius' excellent emendation for the 1011010000
recondit 01 use. The phrase cor-responde to νήχεται in the original. Subdu
isthe Part. of subire (cf. Ov. Far. 1 313 (Gaura) 00010001 subibit cqucs): no
other ea 01 its use is recorded, but 00100101, 001ιο0001 are common
enough, and 110 find Ov. 11011 37 embrica terrae, 010. 00100111. 36 011-
