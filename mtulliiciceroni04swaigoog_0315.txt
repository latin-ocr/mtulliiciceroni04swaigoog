will not allow that even themora general view of Providence is incom-
patible with religione hope (VI 44) εί δὲ μὴ ἐβουλεύσαντο κατ’ ίδίαν πιρί ι’μοῦ,

συμβαίνοντα ἀσπάζεσθαι καὶ στέργειν ὀφείλω.

contrahere universitatem genens hnmani: ‘wa may narrow the
scope of our argument in regard to humanity at large ', lit. ‘we may bring
within a narrower compass the whole (i. ο. what affeots the whole) of man·
kind '.

Oh nxvr. ab hujusce terrae continuatione: Abstr. for coner. ‘hom
the continent which we inhabit '.

mamm amdam insulam: ci. Il. P. v1 21 omnis enim torro qaae

latitudo), ρανυα medam incedo eet, circumfuso illo mort, quod Atlanteum,
qaod magnam, qoem Oceanum αρραίίαιύι. The idea was first started by
Plato Phaedo p. 109 Β, ‘the earth πάμμεγτί τι εἶναι, καί η’μιῖς οἰκεῖν, τοὺς
μέχρι Ἡρακλείων στηλῶν άπὸ Φάσιδος, ε’ν σμικρᾷ τινι μορίῳ, καί ἄλλους ε’ίλλοθι
πολλοὺς ἐν πολλοῖς τοιούτοις τόποις οίκεῖν’. In the pseudo-Aristotelian dc
Mundo the theory is much more developed ; thus in 3 ξ 2 we read ἦ σύμ·
πασα οίκουμίνη μία νῆσός ε’στιν ύπδ τῆς Ἀτλαντικῆς καλουμένης θαλάσσης
περιρῤεομίνη, ib. ξ 13 πλάτος μίν ε’στι κατά rb βαθύτατον τῆς ἠπείρου βραχύ

διαιρεῖται δὲ είς τε Εύριύπην καί Ἀσίαν καί Λιβύην; ib. ξ 3 ‘it is probable
that there ατο many other continents washed by other seas’. cleomedes
(1 2), no doubt following Posidonius, says ‘there are four οἶκουμέναι in the
earth, two in the northern temperate zone and two in the southern ; those
who live in that which is opposite to curs, in the northern hemisphere, are
called our περίοικοι, those who are diametrically opposite to us are the
ἀντίποδες, those who lie directly to the south of us are the ἄποικοι Their
existence is probabla from reason, but not demonstrated by scienoe'. See
also Strabo 14 ξ 6, 11 3 ξ 5, Plin. ΝΗ. 1166, Bunburyrloc. θοορ. 1 p. 625.

[Rhodum the collocation cithia bytho side of Rome, Athens and
Sparta is noticeable. Rhodes was famous and resembled Athens in three
ways, (1) as having a free constitution, cf. u P. 147 ia libero αυτουι pepedi,
ct Rhodi, ut Athenis, ib. 111 48, (2) αα α great naval power, Mootl. 54 oca

nostram υιουιοιύαυι disciplina cacalis et gloria recrearit, (3) as a university
town especially farnad for the study of oratory, Brut. 316, Fam. 1117 ᾗ l,

Panaetius was a native cf Rhodes, and Posidonius long resided there as
head of the Stoic school. R.]
