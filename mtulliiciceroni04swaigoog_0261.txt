Vergilias: Max Miiller (Lect. 11 p. 7) derives the name ‘imm virga a
sprout or twig: the name was given by Italian husbandmen, because 111
Italy, when they became visible about May, they marked the return of
summer'. Others connect it with aar or eergo. The word Πλειάδες is
usually connected with πλεῖν, as they marked the sale time ior seiling, but
