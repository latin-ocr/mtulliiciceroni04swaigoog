poets mostly followed the Greeks in regarding Lucina as a name oi Diana,
see Ennius ap. Varro v1116 altili Titana Trivio dedeo stirpem libanam,
V. Ecl. 1v 10 carta face mana, toas jam regnat Apollo: but the Roman

by matrone at the Matronales and invoked in child-birth, as in Plaut. Aac.

we may compare that given in Cornutus 32 01 Loxias, ‘Apollo is so called

Sicily, extending from the earliest period to his own date: much blamed
