, quo regantur : Abl. of Causa, where we might have expected the Abl.
of Agent with ab, but mamam israther abstract than personal ‘an influence
of an all-perfect Reason', as in the parallel passage N. D. 111 10, and
generally in cio, cf. Hamsp. Resp. 9 cited above, ib. 19 deorum aamim

from the Thyestea, apparently the latest play of Ennius (Brat. 78), from ·
which O. quotes also in Tmo. 1107, 11126. There was a play ol Attius on
the same subject (the Atreus) from which a quotation ‘is given below 111 68.
