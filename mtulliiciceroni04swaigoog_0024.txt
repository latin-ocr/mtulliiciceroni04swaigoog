Δ 11 isevident that the subjectos Natural Theology is one which

‚ requires for its treatment a wide acquaintance with soienoaj and in
point of fact we find this book ol' Cicero's dealing more or less
with almost all the soiences ⁸known to the audente, from the most
general physieal speculatione down to particular theorias of geo
metry and astronomy aud the various scieneos of obsemation,
such as geography, botrmy, zoology, anatomy, anthropology, and
sooiology. Now we know that Posidonius was generally regarded as
f the most learned and most scientifie of all the Stoie philosophare ;
thus Galen, who quotes him largely on questions relating to human
physiology and psychology, calls him αι ἐπιστημονικῶτατος τῶν Sepiada
dui τό γεγυμνάσθαι κατὰ γεωμετρίαν (Hipp. et Plar. p. 652 K.) ; Cleo-

⁸ medes confessos that he compiled his treatise on Astronomy principally
from his writings (Cleom. 11 7 ταῖ πολλὰ τῶν εἰρημένων ἐκ τῶν τοῦ Ποσει-
δωνίου (tadmor), and Strabo, who often cites him in his Geogmphy‚
speaks of him as ἀνήρ τῶν καθ’ η’μᾶς φιλοσόφων πολυμαθέστατος (ser.
xvi 2 5 10). Ι shall proceed to show in detail 11111118 far as we are
able to test the matter, there is a remarkable agreement between tho
scientific views of Posidonius and thore put forward in this book.
First as to Astronomy, which occupies tha most prominent place in
the argument, Oicero refers expressly to the orrery of Posidonius
(§ 88), as illustrating and justiiying the process by which we infer
the existence of asuperintending mind from tha observation ol the
moraments of the heavenly bodies. What Cicero says of the oon-
stitution of the sun andrplanets and of their being nourished by
terrestrial vapours, is in accordanee with what we are told of the
views of Posidonius (see §§ 39, 40, 118 with the notes). When
Cicero tells us that tho suuis many times larger than the earth
(ξ 92), that tho moon is rather more than'half the siae of the earth
(§ 103), that Venus and Mereury are between tha earth and the
sun (ξ 52), all this agrees with what wo read in Cleomedes, some-

· times with the express addition that he is quoting from Posidonius,
while it is inconsistent with the views of the older Stoica. The same
agreement is to be found in regard to tho propertias of the sphera
and its peculiar mobility (ξ 48), the stability of the universe and the
question aa to the chlic (loniiagration on which Posidonius appears
to have expressed himself as doubtfully as Oioero(§§85, 115, 118).
Lunar influence again (ξ) 19, 50, 119) was a favourite study oi
Posidonius He was the first 1ο establish the true theory of the
tides (seeinn. on §§ 19, 132), the inquiry into which 'was stigmatired
