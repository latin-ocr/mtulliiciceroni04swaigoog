ON THE SOUROES OF THE SEOOND BOOK OF THE
· DE NATURA DEORUM.

IN discussing the sources 01 the First Book we 1101010011 what
was Oicero's method in the composition 01 his philosophicel treatises.
They 010 adaptations from Greek originals; and, 01 the comparison 01
the περὶ ἐυσεβείας 01 Philodemus has shown us, Oicero borrows 1101 .
only' the topics and arguments, but even the quotations 01 the author ¹
whom he follows. We need 1101 therefore suppose with Teuffel
(Hirr. os Rom. Lu. 1 113. 10, ed. l) 11101, because Oiccro quotes from-
Aristotle, Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, in the course 01 his
Second Book, he had himself studied the writings 01 these philo
sophers with 0 view 10 111 composition It is much more probable'
11101 he is following in the steps 01 some 10101 writer 01 writers,
and using the quotations which he found there ready 10 hand If ·
we ask who¹ is the writer whom Cicero ismost likely 10 have 101-
ldwed, the 0111101 11 undoubtedly—Posidonius, who is referred 10

· in 1 123 01 familiaris omnium 1100111111, and whose 11001110 ‘on the

Nature of the Gods,' 111010 cited, 1101 been shown to bc the probable
‘authority for the criticism 01 the Epicurean system, contained in the
101101 half of Bk. 1 (cf. Introduction, 101 1, p. lii foll). This sup!
position is confirmed by the fact 11101 the treatises which immediately
preceded and followed the present, viz. the 1110001011 Disputationes
and the De Divinatione (not 10 mention other writings of Cicero) 010
