the livor 10 τὸ πρότον τῆς αἱματώσεως ὄργανον (0 12). The numerous veina
which convey the chyle to the liver all unite into a single trunk at the
portae and then again subdivide into a vast number 01 small veina in order
to imbibe 110 substance ο1 110 liver and so thoroughly olarify the 'blood

quae pertinent ad Jecur: 101 these otoo (‘ohannels ', used in the
same general way as πόροι by Arist) do not really extend 10 the livor ; they
unite, 00 before said, in the 0010 portae and then divide again.

1001100010, and edd are probably right in inserting alio with Heind but,
in 110 general doubtfulness 00 10 what O.'s ideas 00 110 subject were, it is
difficolt 10 speak with confidence 00 to the particular reading required.
We should have expected to hear something 01 the distribution 01 110

from Galen above, we might suppose 1100100 to signify certain ducts by
which the secretione are carried 10110 gall bladder and the spleen; but O.’s
words seem to imply that heis still following 110 course 01 110 main stream
01 110 chyle, which he apparently imagines to visit successively the livor,
the spleen and 110 kidneys, depositing 10 each the ingrediare which belongs
to it, yellow and blank bile and 00001, 110 principle of urina (see quotations
from Galen in next note), and thence returning to the portae and dis-
charging itself into the 0000 caco. Τ10 true account seems to be as

· follows: the blood in 110 coco ponae receives an accession from the spleen

through the splenio vein, but does not part with any 01 110 own ingrediente
either 1ο 110 spleen or 10 110 kidneys until ithae passed through the
heart and returned 00 arteria] blood, from which the secretioris are made.
In its passage through the liver it secretos bile and extracta glooore. · The
livor itself is notan excretory organ.
