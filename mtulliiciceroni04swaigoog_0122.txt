- Bywater (Journal of Philology 111 p. 761011.) shows that the sub
stanes of this 1001101111 probably derived from Aristotle through Cleanthes
and Posidonius, ‘The psychical and cosmical causes, the 111 and 4th
in Cleanthes' series', are stated by Sext. Emp. 111 20 10 have been also
alleged by Aristotle (in the dialogus de philosophia, 'as is generally sup· Α
posed), as the grounds of religious belief. ‘In such abnormal psychical
phenomena 11 dreams, ecstasy, enthusiasm‚ the second-sight with which

ancient distinction, natural as opposed to artificial- divination was based) . ·

. Aristode found an explanation of the 'way in which the mind comes to

but Bywater from acomparison of other writers, makes it probabla that
g ² 111 the original dialogus the two causes were connected' 111 some such
way as follows: ‘tha presentiment, originating 1n the core of our inner
psychical experienoe, acquires a new force and impert, as scon 11 we 1011001
