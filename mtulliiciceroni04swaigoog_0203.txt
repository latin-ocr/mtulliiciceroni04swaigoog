heaven ', comparing the construction 01 καταράομιιι in the epigram ἦν τιν’ ’
ἔχῃς ἐχθρὸν, Διονύσιε, μὴ καταράσῃ τῆνἸσιν τούτῳ. It does not seem that
we have any ex. 01 maceror used in this sense or with Dat.; it is found
absolutely Tusa. 1107 assamur apid Enniam Thyestes ut pereat Atreus,
and with ic and Aac. or with Ace. alone, e. g. ersecror te, or wsecratwr
ia re Liv. 1138, xxx 20. Ktihner translates ‘that to which I will devote
all my powers is this shining vault, whatever its name' ; Sch. agrees in
thinking that acsecror may have this force, ‘to consecrate one thing out 01
all other things '‚ but adds no translation Vahlen and Ribbeck read cerr
for cai referring‘to Hartung lber. Itest. 11 63 ; this seems to me improbable
with the strong phrase quodie me cst. Reading qai (Abl.) I translate
‘Wherefore with all my might Iwill curse this shining heaven '. Mr Roby
remarks that such words would be natural in the mouth of Thyestes, and
that the preceding fragment is taken from the play 01 that name.

Jove lugente: 0111101142 concie perspiciam est, ec psthac admerc-
tiorae hominurn, qaod tensitate jactisque fralmirtam minuissent, redidisse ec
efficere reram omnium praepotentem Jocem? Itaque ire nostres commerueriis
seraptem tabanus: Jove tonante, fulgurante, comite pepedi habere nesam
Vatia. 20 cuperes omnes usqae a Ranae decererarst Jove fulgente carn .
populo agi nefas ease.

dicunt-tonante: if this is not a gloss, we have diunt used in the
sense 01 ‘mean', as in rationem dabo ξ 18, solem dico i 80, not as imme·
diately before. ·

ut multa praeclare: cf. below§ 79 00001000, at mata.

breviter: is plainly inappropriate here. Some have suggested praviter.
Ba refers to Die. 11 107 festive et tresiter, but there terseness is the con-
spicuous quality of the preceding argument: here the lines 01 Euripides
are wordy in comparison with that 01 Ennius. The same may be said 01
the cxx. cited by Mu. (Wectehen’s Jahrb. 1864 p. 134) Le9.1123‚ Ac. 143,
Brut. 14, Fronto p. 254 Nieb. manem sententiam beata et certe cona
cleda. I think Heind. is right in considering it to be a marginal note
calling attention to the abbreviation 01 the famulatae stipate cant
populo agi rwfas.

vidos sublime iusum: translated from an unknown play 01 which this
fragment is fortunately preserved, ὁρᾷς τὸν ὑψοῦ τόνδ’ ἔπειρον αἰθέρα καὶ
γῆν πέριξ ἔχονθ’ ὑγραῖς ἐν ἀγκάλαις· τοῦτον νόμιζε Ζῆνα, τόνδ’ ἦγον θεόν
(fr. 836). Paley (Eunp. 1 p. xxviii) gives other passages in which Eur.
deifies ether. The translation is probably by C. Herod (1 131) says the
Persianas τὸν κύκλον πάντα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ Δία καλοῦσιν.

immoderatum: Lucr. 1 1013 simplice mttere pateat tarsen immode-
ratam.

tenero: so Luor. 1 107 teneras cursen 106 aere teneam ,· Munro re-
marks that ‘the air has the same epithet in Ennius, Virgil and Ovid: it
implies what is solt, yielding, elastic'3 he also cites (tic. Orat. 111176
where matio is described as tenera.
