Sch. Τ1001011000110010(0,0000.01371) that the Stoics considered their

‘to bring 1ο perlection', hence Zeus Orouion '‘the son 01 Perfeetion’) puts
an end 10 the excessivo fecundity 01 Uranus, and thus allows the various
powers 01 earth and heaven to grow 1ο maturity. He compares it with
other myths in which heaven and earth are said to have been 00 closely
joined at first that there was scarcely room for the other gods 10 exist be-
tween thern. · ·
