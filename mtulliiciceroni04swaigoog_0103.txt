was officially connected, having acted as its patron in the cause against
the town of Interamna. The waters of the river Velinus, which flows
through II, are so strongly impregnated with carbonata of lime, that they
are continually forming deposits of travertine, and thus tending to block up
their own channel; so that unless their course was artificially regulated,
the valley of the Velinus was liable to be inundated3 while, if these waters
were carried off too rapidly into the Nar, which runs ata much lower level,
the valley of that river and the territory of Interamna suffered thesemo
fate. (II. H. Bunbury in Dict. cf (ι’-909.) In the speech Pro Scauro 27 Cic, .
mentions that he visited the locality in order to be thoroughly informed of
’ the facts: compare alscAtt. IV 15 and3 Cat. 5, where he speaks of his body·
guard of Reatines. The Italian towns are classified by O. (dect. 32, 2 Pet.

which etjus dicebatur ct uuudiaae agebantur et erat quaedam earum res pub·
tica, repere tamea magistratus suos tabcbaut. He mentions Reate among
the praefecturae to which one praefectus was sent annually by the praetor
urbauus; in other cases there were, several praefecti elected by the
immediate vote of thc Populus Rcraauus. After the 2nd Punic war
Capua was punished by being degraded into a praefectura. The nameprae·
fectus recalls the old conquests of Rome, when a Roman governor was sent
with a colony to overawe the inhabitants of some Latin or Samnite town,

curu purpurea ueste processit, cf. Hand Thrsell. II p. 144. Oura in such
cases is used idiomatically, instead of amore definite preposition, to give
prominence to some accessory circumstance. So in Gr. we find (Xen.
